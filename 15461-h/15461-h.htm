      <i>Introduction</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      This book merits more attention and respect from literary
      historians than thus far have been accorded it. The case must be
      stated carefully. The work has obvious faults and limitations,
      which probably account for its never having been reprinted since
      its appearance in 1687. Almost forty percent of it is largely or
      entirely derivative. Its author, William Winstanley (1628?-1698),
      was undoubtedly a compiler and a hack-writer; his attitudes and
      methods can hardly be termed "scholarly." Nevertheless, this
      pioneer in biographical and bibliographical research was more
      nearly a scholar than the man he is usually alleged to have
      plagiarized; he wanted to <i>see</i> the books that Edward
      Phillips was often content merely to list by title in his
      <i>Theatrum Poetarum</i> (1675), and altogether, for his own
      enjoyment and that of his readers, he quoted from the works of
      more than sixty poets. Moreover, unlike Phillips, he tried to
      arrange his authors in chronological order, from Robert of
      Gloucester to Sir Roger L'Estrange.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Winstanley's <i>Lives</i> advertises on its title page
      accounts "of above Two Hundred" poets, only 147 are actually
      listed in the catalogue, and only 168 are noted throughout. Of
      these 168, only 34 had not already been mentioned by Phillips, a
      dozen years before. Some borrowing was inevitable, and, in fact,
      Winstanley leaned heavily upon both Phillips and Fuller for
      information and clues, just as Phillips had leaned heavily upon
      Bale's <i>Summarium</i> (1548), Camden's <i>Remains</i>,
      Puttenham's <i>Art of English Poesy</i>, several Elizabethan
      miscellanies, and Kirkman's play catalogues. Both men built (as
      scholars must build) upon the obvious materials available. Both
      (in the manner of their age) were extremely casual about
      documentation and acknowledgment. If this leads us to talk
      unhistorically about "theft," we must say that Phillips "stole"
      from a half dozen or so people, whereas Winstanley simply
      appropriated a lot of these stolen goods. For doing so, he alone
      has been labelled a plagiarist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us be more specific. Of Winstanley's accounts of 168 poets,
      34 seem to have come out of the <i>Theatrum Poetarum</i> with
      nothing new added (10 of these 34 merely named). Of the remaining
      134 accounts, 34 are of poets not mentioned by Phillips, 29 are
      utterly independent of Phillips, 40 are largely independent (that
      is, they borrow some from Phillips but add more than they
      borrow), and 31 are largely derivative. We would praise a
      doctoral dissertation that succeeded in giving so much new data.
      Winstanley was careless, but he was not lazy, and he had a
      literary conscience of sorts. Often he went to Phillips' sources
      and came away with more than Phillips found (most conspicuously
      in his use of Francis Kirkman's 1671 play catalogue).
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the groundwork had so recently been laid, Winstanley's
      problem, far more than that of Phillips, was one of selection. In
      the <i>Theatrum Poetarum</i> 252 modern British poets are named.
      Of these Winstanley chose to omit the 16 female and 33 Scottish
      poets. Of the remaining 203, he dropped 68, and for the student
      of literary reputation these omissions raise some interesting
      questions. Undoubtedly a few were inadvertent. About a dozen were
      authors noted but not dated by Phillips, and it is probable that
      Winstanley was unable to learn more about them. Fifteen others
      were English poets who apparently did not write in the
      vernacular. An additional fifteen were poets dated by Phillips
      but described as inferior or almost forgotten. Still another
      fifteen were older or early Renaissance poets whose names
      probably meant nothing to Winstanley. On the other hand, he omits
      the following late Renaissance or contemporary poets whose period
      is plainly indicated in the <i>Theatrum Poetarum</i> and who, we
      might suppose, would be known to anyone attempting literary
      history in the year 1687: Richard Barnfield, Thomas Campion,
      Francis Davison, John Hall of Durham, William Herbert, William
      Leighton, Thomas Sackville, Henry Vaughan the Silurist, and
      Samuel Woodford.
    </p>
    <p>
      That most of Winstanley's omissions were deliberate, and were
      prompted by some awareness of literary reputation, is suggested
      not only by his request for help on a revised edition (which
      never materialized) but also by the fact that he was able to add
      to the <i>Theatrum Poetarum</i> thirty-four poets, almost all of
      whom could have been noted by Phillips. Among these were such
      recent poets as Thomas Tusser, Giles Fletcher the elder, Sir John
      Beaumont, Jasper Heywood, Philemon Holland, Sir Thomas Overbury,
      John Taylor the Water Poet, and the Earl of Rochester. The reader
      of this volume may want to have the additional names before him;
      they are: Sir John Birkenhead, Henry Bradshaw, William
      Chamberlayne, Hugh Crompton, John Dauncey, John Davies (d. 1618),
      Robert Fabyan, John Gower (fl. 1640), Lewys Griffin, "Havillan,"
      Richard Head, Matthew Heywood, John Higgins, Thomas Jordan, Sir
      William Killigrew, Sir Roger L'Estrange, Matthew of Paris, John
      Oldham, Edward Phillips himself, John Quarles, Richard the
      Hermit, John Studley, John Tatham, Christopher Tye, Sir George
      Wharton, and William of Ramsey. Mentioned incidentally are John
      Owen, Laurence Whitaker, and Gawin Douglas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the accounts that are utterly independent of Phillips are
      those of Churchyard, Chapman, Daniel, Ford, Cower, Lydgate, Lyly,
      Massinger, Nashe, Quarles, Suckling, Surrey, and Sylvester. Among
      those that add more than they borrow are the notices of Beaumont
      and Fletcher, Chaucer, Cleveland, Corbet, Donne, Drayton, Phineas
      Fletcher, Greene, Greville, Jonson, Lodge, Lovelace, Middleton,
      More, Randolph, Shakespeare, Sidney, Spenser, Warner, and
      Withers.
    </p>
    <p>
      To a modern critic Winstanley may seem devoid of taste, but his
      acquaintance with English poetry is impressive. Indeed,
      Winstanley, unlike Phillips, strikes us as a man who really read
      and enjoyed poetry. Phillips is more the slipshod bibliographer
      and cataloguer, collecting names and titles; Winstanley is the
      amateur literary historian, seeking out the verse itself,
      arranging it in chronological order, and trying, by his dim
      lights, to pass judgment upon it.

      The Judicious Philosopher <i>Philo-Judæus,</i> in his Book <i>De
      Plantatione</i> Noe, saith; <i>That when God had made the whole
      World's Mass, he created Poets to celebrate and set out the
      Creator himself, and all his Creatures:</i> such a high Estimate
      had he of those Genius of brave Verse. Another saith, that Poets
      were the first <i>Politicians</i>, the first <i>Philosophers</i>,
      and the first <i>Historiographers</i>. And although Learning and
      Poetick Skill were but very rude in this our Island, when it
      flourished to the height in <i>Greece</i> and <i>Rome</i>, yet
      since hath it made such improvement, that we come not behind any
      Nation in the World, both in Grandity and Gravity, in Smoothness
      and Propriety, in Quickness and Briefness; so that for <i>Skill,
      Variety, Efficacy</i> and <i>Sweetness</i>, the four material
      points required in a Poet, our <i>English</i> Sons of
      <i>Apollo,</i> and Darlings of the <i>Delian Deity,</i> may
      compare, if not exceed them

      And indeed what is it that so masters Oblivion, and causeth the

      Poesie? How are the Names forgotten of those mighty Monarchs, the
      Founders of the <i>Egyptian Pyramids</i>, when that
      <i>Ballad-Poet, Thomas Elderton</i>, who did arm himself with Ale
      (as old Father <i>Ennius</i> did with Wine) is remembred in Mr.

      Structure</i>; a Work well worthy the Pen of a second
      <i>Plutarch</i>; since Poetical Devices have been well esteemed.
      even amongst them who have been ignorant of what they are; as the
      judicious Mr. <i>Cambden</i> reports of <i>Sieur Gauland</i>,
      who, when he heard a Gentleman express that he was at a Supper,
      where they had not only good Company and good Chear, but also
      savoury <i>Epigrams</i>, and fine <i>Anagrams</i>; he returning
      home, rated and belowted his <i>Cook</i>, as an ignorant
      <i>Scullion</i>, that never dressed or served up to him either
      <i>Epigrams</i> or <i>Anagrams</i>.

      THE PREFACE TO THE READER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As we account those Books best written which mix Profit with
      Delight, so, in my opinion, none more profitable nor delightful
      than those of Lives, especially them of Poets, who have laid out
      themselves for the publick Good; and under the Notion of Fables,
      delivered unto us the highest Mysteries of Learning. These are
      the Men who in their Heroick Poems have made mens Fames live to
      eternity; therefore it were pity (faith <i>Plutarch</i>) that
      those who write to Eternity, should not live so too. Now above
      all Remembrances by which men have endeavoured even in despight
      of Death, to give unto their Fames eternity, for Worthiness and
      Continuance, Books, and Writings, have ever had the Preheminence;
      which made <i>Ovid</i> to give an endless Date to himself, and to
      his <i>Metamorphosis</i>, in these Words;

      But this Ambition, or (give it a more moderate Title), Desire of
      Fame, is naturally addicted to most men; The Triumph of
      <i>Miltiades</i> would not let <i>Themistocles</i> sleep; For
      what was it that <i>Alexander</i> made such a Bustle in the
      world, but only to purchase an immortal Fame? To what purpose
      were erected those stupendious Structures, entituled <i>The
      Wonders of the World, viz.</i> The walls of <i>Babylon</i>, the
      <i>Rhodian Colossus</i>, the Pyramids of <i>Egypt</i>, the Tomb
      of <i>Mausolus, Diana's</i> Temple at <i>Ephesus</i>, the
      <i>Pharoes</i> Watch-Tower, and the Statue of <i>Jupiter</i> in
      Achaya, were they not all to purchase an immortal Fame thereby?
      Nay, how soon was this Ambition bred in the heart of man? for we
      read in <i>Genesis</i> the 11th. how that presently after the
      Flood, the People journeying from the <i>East</i>, they said
      among themselves, <i>Go to, let us build us a City, and a tower,
      whose Top may reach unto Heaven; and let us make us a Name</i>.
      Here you see the intent of their Building was to make them a
      Name, though God made it a Confusion; as all such other lofty
      Buildings built in Blood and Tyranny, of which nothing now
      remains but the Name; which is excellently exprest by <i>Ovid</i>
      in the Fifteenth Book of his <i>Metamorphosis</i>.

      Now though it is the desire of all Writers to purchase to
      themselves immortal Fame, yet is their Fate far different; some
      deserve Fame, and have it; others neither have it, nor deserve
      it; some have it not deserving, and others, though deserving, yet
      totally miss it, or have it not equall to their Deserts: Thus
      have I known a well writ Poem, after a double expence of Brain to
      bring it forth, and of Purse to publish it to the World,
      condemned to the Drudgery of the <i>Chandler</i> or
      <i>Oyl-man</i>, or, which is worse, to light <i>Tobacco</i>. I
      have read in Dr. <i>Fuller's Englands Worthies</i>, that Mr.
      <i>Nathanael Carpenter</i>, that great Scholar for <i>Logick</i>,
      the <i>Mathematicks, Geography</i>, and <i>Divinity</i>, setting
      forth a Book of <i>Opticks</i>, he found, to his great grief, the
      Preface thereof in his Printers House, <i>Casing
      Christmas-Pies</i>, and could never after from his scattered
      Notes recover an Original thereof; thus (saith he) <i>Pearls</i>
      are no <i>Pearls</i>, when <i>Cocks</i> or <i>Coxcombs</i> find
      them.

      There are two things which very much discourage Wit; ignorant
      Readers, and want of <i>Mecænasses</i> to encourage their
      Endeavours. For the first, I have read of an eminent Poet, who
      passing by a company of Bricklayers at work, who were repeating
      some of his Verses, but in such a manner as quite marred the
      Sence and Meaning of them; he snatching up a Hammer, fell to
      breaking their Bricks; and being demanded the reason thereof, he
      told them, that <i>they spoiled his Work, and he spoiled
      theirs</i>. And for the second; what greater encouragement to
      Ingenuity than Liberality? Hear what the Poet <i>Martial</i>
      saith,

      But some will say, it is not so much the <i>Patrons</i> as the
      <i>Poets</i> fault, whose wide Mouths speak nothing but Bladders
      and Bumbast, treating only of trifles, the Muses Haberdashers of
      small wares.

      Indeed such Pedlars to the Muses, whose Verse runs like the Tap,
      and whose invention ebbs and flows as the Barrel, deserve not the
      name of Poets, and are justly rejected as the common Scriblers of
      the times: but for such who fill'd with <i>Phebean</i>-fire,
      deserve to be crowned with a wreath of Stars; for such brave
      Souls, the darlings of the <i>Delian</i> Deity, for these to be
      scorn'd, contemn'd, and disregarded, must needs be the fault of
      the times; I shall only give you one instance of a renowned Poet,
      out of the same Author.

        </div>

        <div>

        <div>
          <i>Of all his gains by Verse he could not save</i>
        </div>
        <div>
          <i>Enough to purchase Flannel, and a grave:</i>

        <div>
          <i>Reduc'd to want, he in due time fell sick,</i>

        </div>

    <p>
      Thus you see though we have had some comparable to <i>Homer</i>
      for Heroick Poesie, and to <i>Euripides</i> for Tragedy, yet have
      they died disregarded, and nothing left of them, but that only
      once there were such Men and Writings in being.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall, in the next place, speak something of my Undertakings,
      in writing the Lives of these Renowned Poets. Two things, I
      suppose, may be laid to my charge; the one is the omission of
      some that ought with good reason to have been mentioned; and the
      other, the mentioning of those which without any injury might
      have been omitted. For the first, as I have begg'd pardon at the
      latter end of my Book for their omission, so have I promised, (if
      God spare me life so long) upon the first opportunity, or second
      Edition of this Book, to do them right. In the mean time I should
      think my self much beholding to those persons who would give me
      any intelligence herein, it being beyond the reading and
      acquaintance of any one single person to do it of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, let me tell ye, that by the Name of Poet, many more of
      former times might have been brought in than what I have named,
      as well as those which I have omitted that are now living,
      namely, Sir <i>Walter Rawleigh</i>, Mr. <i>John Weever</i>, Dr.
      <i>Heylin</i>, Dr. <i>Fuller,</i> &amp;c. but the Volume growing
      as big as the Bookseller at present was willing to have it, we
      shall reserve them to another time, they having already eternized
      their Names by the never dying Histories which they have wrote.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then for the second thing which may be objected against me, That
      I have incerted some of the meanest rank; I answer, That
      comparatively, it is a less fault to incert two, than to omit
      one, most of which in their times were of good esteem, though now
      grown out of date, even as some learned Works have been at first
      not at all respected, which afterwards have been had in high
      estimation; as it is reported of Sir <i>Walter Rawleigh</i>, who
      being Prisoner in the Tower, expecting every hour to be
      sacrificed to the <i>Spanish</i> cruelty, some few days before he
      suffered, he sent for Mr. <i>Walter Burre</i>, who had formerly
      printed his first Volume of of <i>the History of the World</i>,
      whom, taking by the hand, after some other discourse, he ask'd
      him, How that Work of his had sold? Mr. <i>Burre</i> returned
      this answer, That it sold so slowly, that it had undone him. At
      which words of his, Sir <i>Walter Rawleigh</i> stepping to his
      Desk, reaches the other part of his History, to Mr. <i>Burre</i>,
      which he had brought down to the times he lived in; clapping his
      hand on his breast, he took the other unprinted part of his Works
      into his hand with a sigh, saying, <i>Ah my Friend, hath the
      first Part undone thee? The second Volume shall undo no more;
      this ungrateful World is unworthy of it</i>; When immediately
      going to the fire-side he threw it in, and set his foot on it
      till it was consumed. As great a Loss to Learning as Christendom
      could have, or owned; for his first Volume after his death sold
      Thousands.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may likewise be objected, That some of these Poets here
      mentioned, have been more famous in other kind of Studies than in
      Poetry, and therefore do not shine here as in their proper sphere
      of fame; but what then, shall their general knowledge debar them
      from a particular notice of their Abilities in this most
      excellent Art? Nor have we scarce any Poet excellent in all its
      Species thereof; some addicting themselves most to the
      <i>Epick</i>, some to the <i>Dramatick</i>, some to the
      <i>Lyrick</i>, other to the <i>Elegiack</i>, the
      <i>Epænitick</i>, the <i>Bucolick</i>, or the <i>Epigram</i>;
      under one of which all the whole circuit of <i>Poetick Design</i>
      is one way or other included.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, should we have mentioned none but those who upon a
      strict scrutiny the Name of Poet doth belong unto, I fear me our
      number would fall much short of those which we have written; for
      as one writes, <i>There are many that have a Fame deservedly for
      what they have writ, even in Poetry itself, who, if they come to
      the test, I question how well they would endure to open their
      Eagle-eyes against the Sun.</i> But I shall wade no further in
      this Discourse, desiring you to accept of what is here written.

      Rhythms in praise of his Native Country, <i>England</i>. Some
      (who consider not the Learning of those times) term him a Rhymer,
      whilst others more courteously call him a Poet: Indeed his
      Language is such, that he is dumb in effect, to the Readers of

    <p>
      <i>Joseph of Exeter</i> was born at the City of <i>Exeter</i> in
      <i>Devonshire</i>, he was also sirnamed <i>Iscanus</i>, from the
      River <i>Isk</i>, now called <i>Esk</i>, which running by that
      City, gave it formerly the denomination of <i>Isca</i>. This
      <i>Joseph</i> (faith my Author) was <i>a Golden Poet in a Leaden
      Age</i>, so terse and elegant were his Conceits and Expressions.
      In his younger years he accompanied King <i>Richard</i> the
      First, in his Expedition into the <i>Holy Land</i>, by which
      means he had the better advantage to celebrate, as he did, the
      <ins class="correction" title=
      "Original reads 'Arts'; see Errata.">Acts</ins> of that warlike
      Prince, in a Poem, entituled <i>Antiochea</i>. He also wrote six
      Books <i>De Bello Trojano</i>, in Heroick Verse, which, as the
      learned <i>Cambden</i> well observes, was no other then that
      Version of <i>Dares Phyrgius</i> into <i>Latine</i> Verse. Yet so
      well was it excepted, that the <i>Dutchmen</i> not long since
      Printed it under the name of <i>Cornelius Nepos</i>, an Author
      who lived in the time of <i>Tully</i>, and wrote many excellent
      pieces in Poetry, but upon a strict view of all his Works, not
      any such doth appear amongst them; they therefore do this
      <i>Joseph</i> great wrong in depriving him the honour of his own
      Works. He was afterwards, for his deserts, preferred to be
      Arch-bishop of <i>Burdeaux</i>, in the time of King <i>John</i>,
      about the year 1210.

      in his time, out of whose Rymes for merry <i>England</i> as

      <i>Matthew Paris</i> is acknowledged by all to be an
      <i>Englishman</i> saving only one or two wrangling Writers, who
      deserve to be arraigned of Felony for robbing our Country of its
      due; and no doubt <i>Cambridgeshire</i> was the County made happy
      by his birth, where the Name and Family of <i>Paris</i> is right
      ancient, even long before they were setled therein at
      <i>Hildersham</i>, wherein they still flourish, though much
      impaired for their Loyalty in the late times of Rebellion.

      He was bred a Monk of St. <i>Albans</i>, living in that loose Age
      a very strict and severe life, never less idle than when he was
      alone; spending those hours, reserved from Devotion, in the sweet
      delights of Poetry, and laborious study of History, in both which
      he excelled all his Contemporaries: His skill also was excellent
      in Oratory and Divinity, as also in such manual Arts as lie in
      the Suburbs of the liberal Sciences, Painting, Graving,
      <i>&amp;c.</i> so that we might sooner reckon up those things
      wherein he had no skill, as those wherein he was skilled: But his
      <i>Genius</i> chiefly disposed him for the writing of Histories,
      writing a large Chronicle with great Commendations from the
      <i>Norman</i> Conquest to the Year of our Lord 1250. where he
      concludes with this Distich:

      Yet, notwithstanding this resolution, he afterwards resumed that

      nor sparing others for their Vices, no not so much as those of

    <p>
      This <i>William Ramsey</i> was born in <i>Huntingtonshire</i>, a
      County famous for the richest <i>Benedictines</i> Abbey in
      <i>England</i>; yet here he would not stay, but went to
      <i>Crowland</i>, where he prospered so well, that he became Abbot
      thereof. <i>Bale</i> saith he was a <i>Natural Poet</i>, and
      therefore no wonder if fault be found in the Feet of his Verses;
      but by his leave, he was also a good Scholar, and Arithmetician
      enough to make his Verse run in right Numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      This <i>William</i> wrote the Lives of St. <i>Guthlake</i>, St.
      <i>Neots</i>, St. <i>Edmond</i> the King, and divers others, all
      in Verse, which no doubt were very acceptable and praise-worthy
      in those times; but the greatest wonder of him, and which may
      seem a wonder indeed, was, that being a Poet, he paid the vast
      Debts of others, even forty thousand Marks for the engagement of
      his Covent, and all within the compass of eighteen Months,
      wherein he was Abbot of <i>Crowland</i>. This was a vast Sum in
      that Age, and would render it altogether incredible for a Poet to
      do, but that we find he had therein the assistance of King
      <i>Henry</i> the Second; who, to expiate the Blood of
      <i>Becket</i>, was contented to be melted into Coyn, and was
      prodigiously bountiful to many Churches as well as to this. He
      died about the year 1180.

      <i>John Gower</i>, whom some make to be a Knight, though
      <i>Stow</i>, in his <i>survey of London</i>, unknighteth him, and
      saith he was only an Esquire; however he was born of a knightly
      Family, at <i>Stitenham</i> in the North-Riding in
      <i>Bulmore-Wapentake</i> in <i>Yorkshire</i>. He was bred in
      <i>London</i> a Student of the Laws, but having a plentiful
      Estate, and prizing his pleasure above his profit, he quitted
      Pleading to follow Poetry, being the first refiner of our
      <i>English</i> Tongue, effecting much, but endeavouring more
      therein, as you may perceive by the difference of his Language,
      with that of <i>Robert of Glocester</i>, who lived in the time of
      King <i>Richard</i> the First, which notwithstanding was
      accounted very good in those days.
    </p>
    <p>
      This our <i>Gower</i> was contemporary with the famous Poet
      <i>Geoffry Chaucer</i>, both excellently learned, both great
      friends together, and both alike endeavour'd themselves and
      employed their time for the benefit of their Country. And what an
      account <i>Chaucer</i> had of this our <i>Gower</i> and of his
      Parts, that which he wrote in the end of his Work, entituled
      <i>Troilus &amp; Cressida</i>, do sufficiently testifie, where he
      saith,

      <i>Bale</i> makes him <i>Equitem Auratum &amp; Poetam
      Laureatum</i>, proving both from his Ornaments on his Monumental
      Statue in St. <i>Mary Overies Southwark</i>. Yet he appeareth
      there neither <i>laureated</i> nor <i>hederated</i> Poet, (except
      the leaves of the Bays and Ivy be wither'd to nothing, since the
      erection of the Tomb) but only <i>rosated</i>, having a Chaplet
      of four Roses about his Head, yet was he in great respect both
      with King <i>Henry</i> the Fourth, and King <i>Richard</i> the
      Second, at whose request he wrote his Book called <i>Confessio
      Amantis</i>, as he relateth in his Prologue to the same Book, in

      He was before <i>Chaucer</i>, as born and flourishing before him,
      (yea, by some accounted his Master) yet was he after
      <i>Chaucer</i>, as surviving him two years, living to be stark
      blind, and so more properly termed our <i>English Homer</i>. His
      death happened <i>Anno</i> 1402. and was buried at St. <i>Mary
      Overies</i> in <i>Southwark</i>, on the North side of the said
      Church, in the Chappel of St. <i>John</i>, where he founded a
      Chauntry, and left Means for a Mass, (such was the Religion of
      those times) to be daily sung for him, as also an <i>Obit</i>
      within the same Church to be kept on Friday after the Feast of
      St. <i>Gregory</i>. He lieth under a Tomb of stone, with his
      Image also of stone over him, the hair of his head auburn long to
      his shoulders, but curling up, and a small forked beard; on his
      head a Chaplet, like a Coronet of four Roses; an habit of purple,
      damasked down to his feet, a Collar of Esses of Gold about his
      neck, which being proper to places of Judicature, makes some
      think he was a Judge in his old age. Under his feet the likeness
      of three Books, which he compiled, the first named <i>Speculum
      Meditantis</i>, written in <i>French</i>: the second, <i>Vox
      Clamantis</i>, penned in <i>Latine</i>: the third, <i>Confessio
      Amantis</i>, written in <i>English</i>, which was Printed by
      <i>Thomas Berthelette</i>, and by him dedicated to King
      <i>Henry</i> the Eighth, of which I have one by me at this
      present. His <i>Vox Clamantis</i> with his <i>Cronica
      Tripartita</i>, and other Works both in <i>Latine</i> and
      <i>French</i>, <i>Stow</i> saith he had in his possession, but
      his <i>Speculum Meditantis</i> he never saw, but heard thereof to
      be in <i>Kent</i>.

      All I shall add is this, That about fifty years ago there lived
      at <i>Castle-Heningham</i> in <i>Essex</i>, a School-master named
      <i>John Gower</i>, who wrote a witty Poem, called <i>the Castle
      Combate</i>, which was received in that Age with great applause.

      Three several Places contend for the Birth of that famous Poet.
      1. <i>Berkshire</i>, from the words of <i>Leland</i>, that he was
      born <i>in Barocensiprovincia</i>; and Mr. <i>Cambden</i> avoweth
      that <i>Dunington-Castle</i> nigh unto <i>Newbery</i>, was
      anciently his Inheritance. 2. <i>Oxfordshire</i>, where <i>J.
      Pits</i> is positive that his Father was a Knight, and that he
      was born at <i>Woodstock</i>. 3. The Author of his Life, set
      forth 1602. proveth him born in <i>London</i>, out of these his
      own words in the <i>Testament of Love</i>.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <b>Also in the City of London, that is to me so dear and sweet,
        in which I was forth grown, and more kindly love have I to that
        place, than any other in yerth, as every kindely creature hath
        full appetite to that place of his kindly ingendure, and to
        wilne rest and peace in that stede to abide, thilke peace
        should thus there have been broken, which of all wise men is
        commended and desired.</b>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      For his Parentage, although <i>Bale</i> writes, he termeth
      himself <i>Galfridus Chaucer nobili loco natus, &amp; fummæ spei
      juvenis</i>; yet in the opinion of some Heralds (otherwise than
      his Virtues and Learning commended him) he descended not of any
      great House, which they gather by his Arms: And indeed both in
      respect of the Name, which is <i>French</i>, as also by other
      Conjectures, it may be gathered, that his Progenitors were
      Strangers; but whether they were Merchants (for that in places
      where they have dwelled, the Arms of the Merchants of the Staple
      have been seen in the Glass-windows) or whether they were of
      other Callings, it is not much necessary to search; but wealthy
      no doubt they were, and of good account in the Commonwealth, who
      brought up their <ins class="correction" title=
      "Transcriber's note: original reads 'Sons'">Son</ins> in such
      sort, that both he was thought fit for the Court at home, and to
      be employed for Matters of State in Foreign Countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      His Education, as <i>Leland</i> writes, was in both the
      Universities of <i>Oxford</i> and <i>Cambridge</i>, as appeareth
      by his own words, in his Book Entituled <i>The Court of Love</i>:
      And in <i>Oxford</i> by all likelihood, in <i>Canterbury</i> or
      in <i>Merton</i> Colledge, improving his Time in the University,
      he became a witty Logician, a sweet Rhetorician, a grave
      Philosopher, a holy Divine, a skilful Mathematician, and a
      pleasant Poet; of whom, for the Sweetness of his Poetry, may be
      said that which is reported of <i>Stesichorus</i>; and as
      <i>Cethegus</i> was called <i>Suadæ Medulla</i>, so may
      <i>Chaucer</i> be rightly called the Pith and Sinews of
      Eloquence, and the very Life it self of all Mirth and pleasant
      Writing. Besides, one Gift he had above other Authors, and that
      is, by the Excellencies of his Descriptions to possess his
      Readers with a stronger imagination of seeing that done before
      their eyes which they read, than any other that ever writ in any
      Tongue. But above all, his Book of <i>Canterbury-Tales</i>, is
      most recommended to Posterity, which he maketh to be spoken by
      certain Pilgrims who lay at the <i>Tabard</i>-Inn in
      <i>Southwark</i> as he declareth in the beginning of his said
      Book.

      By his Travel also in <i>France</i> and <i>Flanders</i>, where he
      spent much time in his young years, but more in the latter end of
      the Reign of King <i>Richard</i> the Second; he attained to a
      great perfection in all kind of Learning, as <i>Bale</i> and
      <i>Leland</i> report of him: <i>Circa postremos</i> Richardi
      <i>Secundi annos</i>, Galliis <i>floruit, magnamque illic ex
      assidua in Literis exercitatione gloriam sibi comparavit. Domum
      reversus Forum</i> Londinense; <i>&amp; Collegia</i> Leguleiorum,
      <i>qui ibidem Patria Jura interpretantur frequentavit</i>,
      &amp;c. About the latter end of King <i>Richard</i> the Second's
      Days, he flourished in <i>France</i>, and got himself into high
      esteem there by his diligent exercise in Learning: After his
      return home, he frequented the Court at <i>London</i>, and the
      Colledges of the <i>Lawyers</i>, which there interpreted the Laws
      of the Land. Amongst whom was <i>John Gower</i>, his great
      familiar Friend, whose Life we wrote before. This <i>Gower</i>,
      in his Book entituled <i>Confessio Amantis</i>, termeth
      <i>Chaucer</i> a worthy Poet, and maketh him as it were the Judge
      of his Works.
    </p>
    <p>
      This our <i>Chaucer</i> had always an earnest desire to enrich
      and beautifie our <i>English</i> Tongue, which in those days was
      very rude and barren; and this he did, following the example of
      <i>Dantes</i> and <i>Petrarch</i>. who had done the same for the
      <i>Italian</i> Tongue, <i>Alanus</i> for the <i>French</i>, and
      <i>Johannes Mea</i> for the <i>Spanish</i>: Neither was
      <i>Chaucer</i> inferior to any of them in the performance hereof;
      and <i>England</i> in this respect is much beholding to him; as
      <i>Leland</i> well noteth:

      devenit, sensitque Senectutem morbum esse</i>; <i>&amp; dum
      Causas suas</i> Londini <i>curaret</i>, &amp;c. <i>Chaucer</i>
      lived till he was an old man, and found old Age to be grievous;
      and whilst he followed his Causes at <i>London</i>, he died, and
      was buried at <i>Westminster</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old Verses which were written on his Grave at the first, were
      these;

      <i>Thomas Occleue</i>, or <i>Okelefe</i>, of the Office of the
      Privy Seal, sometime Chaucer's Scholar, for the love he bore to
      the said <i>Geoffrey</i> his Master, caused his Picture to be
      truly drawn in his Book, <i>De Regimine Principis</i>, dedicated
      to <i>Henry</i> the Fifth; according to which, that his Picture
      drawn upon his Monument was made, as also the Monument it self,
      at the Cost and Charges of <i>Nicolas Brigham</i> Gentleman,
      <i>Anno</i> 1555. who buried his Daughter <i>Rachel</i>, a Child
      of four years of Age, near to the Tomb of this old Poet, the
      <i>21th</i>. of <i>June</i> 1557. Such was his Love to the Muses;
      and on his Tomb these Verses were inscribed:

      And as for men of latter time, Mr.<i>Ascham</i> and Mr.
      <i>Spenser</i> have delivered most worthy Testimonies of their
      approving of him. Mr.<i>Ascham</i>, in one place calleth him
      <i>English Homer</i>, and makes no doubt to say, that he valueth
      his Authority of as high estimation as he did either
      <i>Sophocles</i> or <i>Euripides</i> in <i>Greek</i>. And in
      another place, where he declareth his Opinion of <i>English</i>
      Versifying, he useth these Words; Chaucer <i>and</i> Petrark
      <i>those two worthy Wits, deserve just praise</i>. And last of
      all, in his Discourse of <i>Germany</i>, he putteth him nothing
      behind either <i>Thucydides</i> or <i>Homer</i>, for his lively
      Descriptions of Site of Places, and Nature of Persons, both in
      outward Shape of Body, and inward Disposition of Mind; adding
      this withal, That not the proudest that hath written in any
      Tongue whatsoever, for his time hath outstript him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. <i>Spenser</i> in his first Eglogue of his <i>Shepherds
      Kalendar</i>, calleth him <i>Tityrus</i>, the God of Shepherds,
      comparing him to the worthiness of the <i>Roman Tityrus,
      Virgil</i>. In his <i>Fairy Queen</i>, in his Discourse of
      Friendship, as thinking himself most worthy to be
      <i>Chaucer</i>'s friend, for his like natural disposition that
      <i>Chaucer</i> had; he writes, That none that lived with him, nor
      none that came after him, durst presume to revive
      <i>Chaucer</i>'s lost labours in that imperfect Tale of the
      Squire, but only himself: which he had not done, had he not felt
      (as he saith) the infusion of <i>Chaucer</i>'s own sweet Spirit
      surviving within him. And a little before, he calls him the most
      Renowned and Heroical Poet, and his Writings the Works of
      Heavenly Wit; concluding his commendation in this manner:

      Mr. <i>Cambden</i>, reaching one hand to Mr. <i>Ascham</i>, and
      the other to Mr. <i>Spenser</i>, and so drawing them together,
      uttereth of him these words, <i>De</i> Homero <i>nostro</i>
      Anglico <i>illud vere asseram, quod de</i> Homero <i>eruditus

      The deservingly honoured Sir <i>Philip Sidney</i>, in his
      <i>Defence of Poesie</i>, thus writeth of him, Chaucer
      <i>undoubtedly did excellently in his</i> Troylus <i>and</i>
      Crescid, <i>of whom truly I know not whether to marvel more,
      either that he in that misty time could see so clearly or we in
      this clear age walk so stumblingly after him.</i> And Doctor
      <i>Heylin</i>, in his elaborate Description of the World, ranketh
      him in the first place of our chiefest Poets. Seeing therefore
      that both old and new Writers have carried this reverend conceit
      of him, and openly declared the same by writing, let us conclude
      with <i>Horace</i> in the eighth Ode of his fourth Book;

      The Works of this famous Poet, were partly published in Print by
      <i>William Caxton</i>, Mercer, that first brought the
      incomparable Art of Printing into <i>England</i>, which was in
      the Reign of King <i>Henry</i> the Sixth. Afterward encreased by
      <i>William Thinne</i>, Esq; in the time of King <i>Henry</i> the
      Eighth. Afterwards, in the year 1561. in the Reign of Queen
      <i>Elizabeth</i>, Corrected and Encreased by <i>John Stow</i>;
      And a fourth time, with many Amendments, and an Explanation of
      the old and obscure Words, by Mr. <i>Thomas Speight</i>, in
      <i>Anna</i> 1597. Yet is he said to have written many
      considerable Poems, which are not in his publish'd Works, besides
      the <i>Squires Tale</i>, which is said to be compleat in
      <i>Arundel-house</i> Library.

    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>John Lydgate</i> was born in a Village of the same name, not
      far off St. <i>Edmondsbury</i>, a Village (saith <i>Cambden</i>)
      though small, yet in this respect not to be passed over in
      silence, because it brought into the World <i>John Lydgate</i>
      the Monk, whose Wit may seem to have been framed and fashioned by
      the very Muses themselves: so brightly reshine in his
      <i>English</i> Verses, all the pleasant graces and elegancy of
      Speech, according to that Age. After some time spent in our
      <i>English</i> Universities, he travelled through <i>France</i>
      and <i>Italy</i>, improving his time to his great accomplishment,
      in learning the Languages and Arts; <i>Erat autem non solum
      elegans Poeta, &amp; Rhetor disertus, verum etiam Mathematicus
      expertus, Philosophus acutus, &amp; Theologus non
      contemnendus</i>: he was not only an elegant Poet, and an
      eloquent Rhetorician, but also an expert Mathematician, an acute
      Philosopher, and no mean Divine, saith <i>Pitseus</i>. After his
      return, he became Tutor to many Noblemens Sons, and both in Prose
      and Poetry was the best Author of his Age, for if
      <i>Chaucer's</i> Coin were of greater Weight for deeper Learning,
      <i>Lydgate's</i> was of a more refined Stantard for purer
      Language; so that one might mistake him for a modern Writer. But
      because none can so well describe him as himself, take an Essay
      of his Verses, out of his <i>Life and Death of</i> Hector,

      the Story of <i>Thebes</i>, a Tale (as his Fiction is) which (or
      some other) he was constrained to tell, at the command of mine
      Host of the <i>Tabard</i> in <i>Southwark</i>, whom he found in
      <i>Canterbury</i>, with the rest of the Pilgrims which went to
      visit Saint <i>Thomas</i> shrine.

    <p>
      This Story was first written in <i>Latine</i> by <i>Geoffry
      Chaucer</i>, and translated by <i>Lydgate</i> into <i>English</i>
      Verse, but of the Prologue of his own making, so much as concerns
      himself, thus:

      in Verse, many exquisite learned Books, saith <i>Pitseus</i>,
      which are mentioned by him and <i>Bale</i>, as also in the latter
      end of <i>Chaucer's</i> Works; the last Edition, amongst which
      are <i>Eglogues</i>, <i>Odes</i>, <i>Satyrs</i>, and other Poems.
      He flourished in the Reign of <i>Henry</i> the Sixth, and
      departed this world (aged about 60 years) <i>circiter</i> An.
      1440. and was buried in his own Convent at <i>Bury</i>, with this

      <a name="john_h" id="john_h"></a><i>JOHN HARDING</i>.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>John Harding</i>, our Famous <i>English</i> Chronologer, was
      born (saith <i>Bale</i>) in the Northern parts, and most likely
      in <i>Yorkshire</i>, being an Esquire of an eminent Parentage. He
      was a man equally addicted to Arms and Arts, spending his Youth
      in the one, and his Age in the other: His first Military
      Employment was under <i>Robert Umfreuil</i>, Governor of
      <i>Roxborough</i>-Castle, where he did good Service against the
      <i>Scots</i>. Afterwards he followed the Standard of King
      <i>Edward</i> the Fourth, to whom he valiantly and faithfully
      adhered, not only in the Sun-shine of his Prosperity, but also in
      his deepest Distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what endeared him the most to his Favour, and was indeed the
      Masterpiece of his Service, was his adventuring into
      <i>Scotland</i>; a desperate Attempt, and performed not without
      the manifest hazarding of his Life; where he so cunningly
      demeaned himself, and insinuated himself so far into their
      Favour, as he got a sight of their Records and Original Letters;
      a Copy of which he brought with him to <i>England</i>, and
      presented the same to King <i>Edward</i> the Fourth: Out of these
      he collected a History of the several Submissions, and sacred
      Oaths of Fealty openly taken from the time of King
      <i>Athelstane</i>, by the Kings of <i>Scotland</i>; to the Kings
      of <i>England</i>, for the Crown of <i>Scotland</i>; a Work which
      was afterwards made much use of by the <i>English</i>; although
      the <i>Scotch</i> Historians stickle with might and main, that
      such Homage was performed only for the County of
      <i>Cumberland</i>, and some parcel of Land their Kings had in
      <i>England</i> South of <i>Tweed</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now as his Prose was very useful, so was his Poetry as much
      delightful; writing a Chronicle of our <i>English</i> Kings from
      <i>Brute</i> to King <i>Edward</i> the Fourth, and that in
      <i>English</i> Verse; for which he was accounted one cf the
      chiefest Poets of his time; being so exactly done, that by it Dr.
      <i>Fuller</i> adjudges him to have drunk as deep a draught of
      <i>Helicon</i> as any in his Age: And another saying, that by the
      fame he deservedly claimed a Seat amongst the chiefest of the
      Poetical Writers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to give you the better view of his Poetical Abilities, I
      shall present you with some of his Chronicle-Verse, concerning
      the sumptuous Houshold kept by King <i>Richard</i> the Second,
      <i>cap.</i> 193.

      his time which he had spare from publick Employments, for the
      benefit of posterity; writing two large Chronicles: the one from
      <i>Brute</i> to the Death of King <i>Henry</i> the Second; the
      other, from the First of King <i>Richard</i>, to the Death of
      <i>Henry</i> the Seventh. He was (saith my Author) of a merry
      disposition, and used to entertain his Guests as well with good
      Discourse as good Victuals: He bent his Mind much to the Study of
      Poetry; which according to those times, passed for currant. Take

    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>John Skelton</i>, the Poet Laureat in his Age, tho' now
      accounted only a Rhymer, is supposed to have been born in
      <i>Norfolke</i>, there being an ancient Family of that Name
      therein; and to make it the more probable, he himself was
      Beneficed therein at <i>Dis</i> in that County. That he was
      Learned, we need go no further than to <i>Erasmus</i> for a
      Testimony; who, in his Letter to King <i>Henry</i> the Eighth,
      stileth him, <i>Britanicarum Literarum Lumen &amp; Decus</i>.
      Indeed he had Scholarship enough, and Wit too much: <i>Ejus
      Sermo</i> (saith <i>Pitz.</i>) <i>salsus in mordacem, risus in
      opprobrium, jocus in amaritudinem</i>. Whoso reads him, will find
      he hath a miserable, loose, rambling Style, and galloping measure
      of Verse: yet were good poets so scarce in his Age, that he had
      the good fortune to be chosen Poet Laureat, as he stiles himself
      in his Works, <i>The Kings Orator, and Poet Laureat</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      His chief Works, as many as can be collected, and that out of an
      old Printed Book, are these; <i>Philip Sparrow</i>, <i>Speak
      Parrot</i>, <i>The Death of King</i> Edward <i>the Fourth</i>,
      <i>A Treatise of the</i> Scots, <i>Ware the Hawk</i>, <i>The
      Tunning of</i> Elianer Rumpkin: In many of which, following the
      humor of the ancientest of our Modern Poets, he takes a Poetical
      Liberty of being Satyrical upon the Clergy, as brought him under
      the Lash of Cardinal <i>Woolsey</i>, who so persecuted him, that
      he was forced to take Sanctuary at <i>Westminster</i>, where
      Abbot <i>Islip</i> used him with much respect. In this Restraint
      he died, <i>June</i> 21, 1529. and was buried in St.
      <i>Margaret's</i> Chappel, with this Epitaph;

      We must not forget, how being charg'd by some on his Death-bed
      for begetting many Children on a Concubine which he kept, he
      protested, that in his Conscience he kept her in the notion of a
      Wife, though such his cowardliness, that he would rather confess
      Adultery, than own Marriage, the most punishable at that time.

      Life of his Contemporary and great Antagonist <i>William
      Lillie</i>, born at <i>Odiham</i>, a great Market-Town in
      <i>Hantshire</i>; who to <ins class="correction" title=

      knowledge, in his youth travelled to the City of
      <i>Jerusalem</i>, where having satisfied his curiosity in
      beholding those sacred places where on our Saviour trode when he
      was upon the Earth; he returned homewards, making some stay at
      <i>Rhodes</i>, to study <i>Greek</i>. Hence he went to
      <i>Rome</i>, where he heard <i>John Sulpitius</i> and
      <i>Pomponius Sabinus</i>, great Masters of <i>Latine</i> in those
      days. At his return home, Doctor <i>John Collet</i> had new
      builded a fair School at the East-end of St. <i>Paul</i>'s, for
      153 poor mens Children, to be taught free in the same School; for
      which he appointed a Master, an Usher, and a Chaplain, with large
      Stipends for ever; committing the oversight thereof to the
      Masters, Wardens and Assistants of the <i>Mercers</i> in
      <i>London</i>, because he was Son to <i>Henry Collet</i> Mercer,
      sometime Major; leaving for the Maintenance thereof, Lands to the
      yearly value of 120<i>l</i>. or better; making this <i>William
      Lilly</i> first Master thereof; which Place he commendably
      discharg'd for 15 years. During which time he made his
      <i>Latine</i> Grammar, the Oracle of Free Schools of
      <i>England</i>, and other Grammatical Works. He is said also by
      <i>Bale</i>, to have written Epigrams, and other Poetry of
      various Subjects in various <i>Latine</i> Verse, though scarce
      any of them (unless it be his <i>Grammar</i>) now extant, only
      Mr. <i>Stow</i> makes mention of an Epitaph made by him, and
      graven on a fair Tomb, in the midst of the Chancel of St.

    <p>
      Sir <i>Thomas More</i>, a great Credit and Ornament in his Time,
      of the <i>English</i> Nation, and with whom the Learned'st
      Foreigners of that Age, were proud to have correspondence, for
      his wit and excellent parts, was born in <i>Milk-street</i>,
      London. <i>Anno Dom.</i> 1480. Son to Sir <i>John More</i>,
      Knight, and one of the Justices of the <i>Kings Bench</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was bred first in the Family of Archbishop <i>Morton</i>, then
      in <i>Canterbury</i>-Colledge in <i>Oxford</i>; afterwards
      removed to an Inn of <i>Chancery</i> in <i>London</i>, called
      <i>New-Inn</i>, and from thence to <i>Lincolns-Inn</i>; where he
      became a double Reader. Next, his Worth preferred him to be Judge
      in the Sheriff of <i>London's</i>, Court, though at the same time
      a Pleader in others; and so upright was he therein, that he never
      undertook any Cause but what appeared just to his Conscience, nor
      never took Fee of Widow, Orphan, or poor Person.
    </p>
    <p>
      King <i>Henry</i> the Eighth coming to the Crown, first Knighted
      him, then made him Chancellor of the Duchy of <i>Lancaster</i>,
      and not long after L. Chancellor of <i>England</i>, in which
      place he demeaned himself with great integrity, and with no less
      expedition; so that it is said, at one time he had cleared all
      Suits depending on that Court: whereupon, one thus versified on

      He was of such excellency of Wit and Wisdom, that he was able to
      make his Fortune good in whatsoever he undertook: and to this
      purpose it is reported of him, that when he was sent Ambassador
      by his Master <i>Henry</i> the Eighth into <i>Germany</i>, before
      he deliver'd his Embassage to the Emperor, he bid one of his
      Servants to fill him a Beer-glass of Wine, which he drunk off
      twice; commanding his Servant to bring him a third; he knowing
      Sir <i>Thomas More</i>'s Temperance, that he was not used to
      drink, at first refused to fill him another; telling Sir
      <i>Thomas</i> of the weight of his Employment: but he commanding
      it, and his Servant not daring to deny him, he drank off the
      third, and then made his immediate address to the Emperor, and
      spake his Oration in <i>Latine</i>, to the admiration of all the
      Auditors. Afterwards Sir <i>Thomas</i> merrily asking his Man
      what he thought of his Speech? he said, that he deserved to
      govern three parts of the World, and he believed if he had drunk
      the other Glass, the Elegancy of his Language might have
      purchased the other part of the World.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being once at <i>Bruges</i> in <i>Flanders</i>, an arrogant
      Fellow had set up a <i>Thesis</i>, that he would answer any
      Question could be propounded unto him in what Art soever. Of
      whom, when Sir <i>Thomas More</i> heard, he laughed, and made
      this Question to be put up for him to answer; Whether <i>Averia
      capta in Withernamia sunt irreplegibilia</i>? Adding, That there
      was an <i>Englishman</i> that would dispute thereof with him.
      This bragging <i>Thraso</i>, not so much as understanding the
      Terms of our Common Law, knew not what to answer to it, and so
      became ridiculous to the whole City for his presumptuous
      bragging.

    <p>
      Many were the Books which he wrote; amongst whom his
      <i>Utopia</i> beareth the Bell; which though not written in
      Verse, yet in regard of the great Fancy and Invention thereof,
      may well pass for a Poem, it being the <i>Idea</i> of a compleat
      Commonwealth in an Imaginary Island (but pretended to be lately
      discovered in <i>America</i>) and that so lively counterfeited,
      that many at the reading thereof, mistook it for a real Truth:
      insomuch that many great Learned men, as <i>Budeus</i>, and
      <i>Johannes Paludanus</i> upon a fervent zeal, wished that some
      excellent Divines might be sent thither to preach Christ's
      Gospel: yea, there were here amongst us at home, sundry good Men,
      and learned Divines, very desirous to undertake the Voyage, to
      bring the People to the Faith of Christ, whose Manners they did
      so well like.

      But at last he fell into the King's displeasure, touching the
      Divorce of Queen <i>Katherine</i>, and for refusing to take the
      Oath of Supremacy; for which he was committed to the Tower, and
      afterwards beheaded on <i>Tower-Hill</i>, July 6, 1635, and
      buried at <i>Chelsey</i> under a plain Monument.

      In the Duke of <i>Florence's</i> Court he published a proud
      Challenge against all Comers, whether <i>Christians</i>,
      <i>Turks</i>, <i>Canibals</i>, <i>Jews</i>, or <i>Saracens</i>,
      in defence of his <i>Geraldines</i> Beauty. This Challenge was
      the more mildly accepted, in regard she whom he defended, was a
      Town-born Child of that City; or else the Pride of the
      <i>Italian</i> would have prevented him ere he should have come
      to perform it. The Duke of <i>Florence</i> nevertheless sent for
      him, and demanded him of his Estate, and the reason that drew him
      thereto; which when he was advertiz'd of to the full, he granteth
      all Countries whatsoever, as well Enemies and Outlaws, as Friends
      and Confederates, free access and regress into his Dominions
      immolested, until the Trial were ended.

      But to return, this Earl had together with his Learning, Wisdom,
      Fortitude, Munificence, and Affability; yet all these good and
      excellent parts were no protection against the King's
      Displeasure; for upon the <i>12th</i> of <i>December</i>, the
      last of King <i>Henry</i> the <i>8th.</i> he, with his Father
      <i>Thomas</i> Duke of <i>Norfolk</i>, upon certain surmises of
      Treason, were committed to the Tower of <i>London</i>, the one by
      Water, the other by Land; so that the one knew not of the others
      Apprehension: The <i>15th.</i> day of <i>January</i> next
      following, he was arraigned at Guildhall, <i>London</i>, where
      the greatest matter alledged against him, was, for bearing
      certain Arms that were said belonged to the King and Prince; the
      bearing whereof he justified. To be short, (for so they were with
      him) he was found guilty by twelve common Juriars, had Judgment
      of Death; and upon the <i>19th</i> day of the said Month (nine
      days before the Death of the said King <i>Henry</i>, was beheaded
      at <i>Tower-Hill</i>) He was at first interred in the Chappel of
      the Tower, and afterwards, in the Reign of King <i>James</i>, his
      Remainders of Ashes and Bones were removed to <i>Framingham</i>
      in <i>Suffolk</i>, by his second Son <i>Henry</i> Earl of
      <i>Northampton</i>, where in the Church they were interred, with

      This worthy Knight is termed by the Name of the Elder, to
      distinguish him from Sir <i>Thomas Wiat</i> the raiser of the
      Rebellion in the time of Queen <i>Mary</i>, and was born at
      <i>Allington</i> Castle in the County of <i>Kent</i>; which
      afterwards he repaired with most beautiful Buildings. He was a
      Person of great esteem and reputation in the Reign of King
      <i>Henry</i> the <i>8th.</i> with whom, for his honesty and
      singular parts, he was in high favour. Which nevertheless he had
      like to have lost about the Business of Queen <i>Anne
      Bullein</i>; but by his Innocency, Industry and Prudence, he
      extricated himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was one of admirable ingenuity, and truly answer'd his
      Anagram, <i>Wiat</i>, a Wit, the judicious Mr. <i>Cambden</i>
      saith he was.

      In the writing this Doctors Life, we shall principally make use
      for Directions of Mr. <i>Fuller</i>, in his <i>England's
      Worthies</i>, fol. 244. He flourished (saith he) in the Reign of
      King <i>Henry</i> the Eighth, and King <i>Edward</i> the Sixth,
      to whom he was one of the Gentlemen of their Chappel, and
      probably the Organist. Musick, which received a grievous wound in
      <i>England</i> at the dissolution of Abbeys, was much beholding
      to him for her recovery; such was his excellent Skill and Piety,
      that he kept it up in Credit at Court, and in all Cathedrals
      during his life: He translated <i>the Acts of the Apostles</i>
      into Verse, and let us take a tast his Poetry.

      This <i>Abraham Fraunce</i>, a Versifier, about the same time
      with <i>John Higgins</i>, was one who imitated <i>Latine</i>
      measure in <i>English</i> Verse, writing a Pastoral, called
      <i>the Countess of</i> Pembroke's <i>Ivy-church</i>, and some
      other things in Hexameter, some also in Hexameter and Pentameter;
      He also wrote <i>the Countess of</i> Pembroke's <i>Emanuel</i>,
      containing the Nativity, Passion, Burial, and Resurrection of
      Christ, together with certain Psalms of <i>David</i>, all in
      <i>English</i> Hexameters. Nor was he altogether singular in this
      way of writing, for Sir <i>Philip Sidney</i> in the Pastoral
      Interludes of his <i>Arcadia</i>, uses not only these, but all
      other sorts of <i>Latine</i> measure, in which no wonder he is
      followed by so few, since they neither become the <i>English</i>,
      nor any other modern Language.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began also the Translation of <i>Heliodorus</i> his
      <i>Æthiopick</i> History, in the same kind of Verse, of which, to

      Having attained to some perfection in the <i>Latine</i> Tongue,
      he was sent to <i>Trinity-Hall</i> in <i>Cambridge</i>, where he
      had not continued long, but he was vexed with extream sickness,
      whereupon he left the University, and betook himself to Court,
      and lived for a while under the Lord <i>Paget</i>, in King
      <i>Edward</i> the Sixth's days; when, the Lords falling at
      dissention, he left the Court, and went to <i>Suffolk</i>, where
      he married his first Wife, and took a Farm at <i>Ratwade</i> in
      that County, where he first devised his Book of Husbandry, but
      his Wife not having her health there, he removed from thence to
      <i>Ipswich</i> and soon after buried her.

    <p>
      Not long after he married again to one Mrs. <i>Amy Moon</i>, upon

      Being thus married he betook himself again to Husbandry, and
      hired a Farm, called <i>Diram Cell</i>, and there he had not
      lived long, but his Landlord died, and his Executors falling at
      variance, and now one troubled him, and then another, whereupon
      he left <i>Diram</i>, and went to <i>Norwich</i>, turning a
      Singing-man under Mr. <i>Salisbury</i>, the Dean thereof; There
      he was troubled with a <i>Dissury</i>, so that in a 138 Hours he
      never made a drop of Water. Next he hired a Parsonage at
      <i>Fairstead</i> in <i>Essex</i>, but growing weary of that he
      returned again to <i>London</i>, where he had not lived long, but
      the Pestilence raging there, he retired to <i>Cambridge</i>: Thus
      did he roul about from place to place, but, like <i>Sisiphus</i>
      stone, could gather no Moss whithersoever he went: He was
      successive a Musician, Schoolmaster, Servingman, Husbandman,
      Grasier, Poet, more skilful in all, than thriving in any
      Vocation. He traded at large in Oxen, Sheep, Dairies, Grain of
      all kinds, to no profit. He spread his Bread with all sorts of
      Butter, yet none would stick thereon. So that he might say with

    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Robert Greene</i> (that great Friend to the <i>Printers</i> by
      his many Impressions of numerous Books) was by Birth a Gentleman,
      and sent to study in the University of <i>Cambridge</i>; where he
      proceeded Master of Art therein. He had in his time sipped of the
      Fountain of <i>Hellicon</i>, but drank deeper Draughts of Sack,
      that <i>Helliconian</i> Liquor, whereby he beggar'd his Purse to
      enrich his Fancy; writing much against Viciousness, but too
      vicious in his Life. He had to his Wife a Virtuous Gentlewoman,
      whom yet he forsook, and betook himself to a high course of
      Living; to maintain which, he made his Pen mercenary, making his
      Name very famous for several Books which he wrote, very much
      taking in his time, and in indifferent repute amongst the vulgar
      at this present; of which, those that I have seen, are as
      followeth) Euphues <i>his Censure to</i> Philautus; Tullies
      <i>Love</i>, <i>Philomela</i>, <i>The Lady</i> Fitz-waters
      <i>Nightingale</i>, <i>A Quip for an upstart Courtier</i>, <i>the
      History of</i> Dorastus <i>and</i> Fawnia, Green's <i>never too
      late</i>, first and second Part; Green's <i>Arcadia</i>, Green
      <i>his Farewell to Folly</i>, Greene's <i>Groats-worth of Wit,
      &amp;c.</i> He was also an Associate with Dr. <i>Lodge</i> in
      writing of several Comedies; namely, <i>The Laws of Nature</i>;
      <i>Lady Alimony</i>; <i>Liberality and Prodigality</i>; and a
      Masque called <i>Luminalia</i>; besides which, he wrote alone the
      Comedies of <i>Fryer Bacon</i>, and <i>fair Emme</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But notwithstanding by these his Writings he got much Money, yet
      was it not sufficient to maintain his Prodigality, but that
      before his death he fell into extream Poverty, when his Friends,
      (like Leaves to Trees in the Summer of Prosperity) fell from him
      in his Winter of Adversity: of which he was very sensible, and
      heartily repented of his ill passed Life, especially of the
      wrongs he had done to his Wife; which he declared in a Letter
      written to her, and found with his Book of <i>A Groatsworth of
      Wit</i>, after his Death, containing these Words;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>The Remembrance of many Wrongs offered Thee and thy
        unreproved Vertues, add greater sorrow to my miserable State
        than I can utter, or thou conceive; neither is it lessened by
        consideration of thy Absence (though Shame would let me hardly
        behold thy Face) but exceedingly aggravated, for that I cannot
        (as I ought) to thy own self reconcile my self, that thou
        mightest witness my inward Wo at this instant, that have made
        thee a woful Wife for so long a time. But equal Heaven hath
        denied that comfort, giving at my last need, like Succour as I
        have sought all my Life: Being in this extremity, as void of
        help, as thou hast been of hope. Reason would that after so
        long waste, I should not send thee a Child to bring the Charge,
        but consider he is the fruit of thy Womb, in whose Face regard
        not the Father's so much as thy own Perfections: He is yet</i>
        Green, <i>and may grow strait, if he be carefully tended;
        otherwise apt enough (I fear me) to follow his Fathers Folly.
        That I have offended thee highly, I know; that thou canst
        forget my Injuries, I hardly believe; yet I perswade my self,
        if thou sawest my wretched estate, thou couldst not but lament
        it: Nay, certainly I know thou wouldst. All my wrongs muster
        themselves about me, and every Evil at once plagues me: For my
        Contempt of God, I am contemned of Men; for my swearing and
        forswearing, no man will believe me; for my Gluttony I suffer
        Hunger; for my Drunkenness Thirst; for my Adultery, ulcerous
        Sores: Thus God hath cast me down that I might be humbled, and
        punisht me for example of others; and though he suffers me in
        this world to perish without succour, yet trust I in the world
        to come to find Mercy by the Merits of my Saviour; to whom I
        commend thee, and commit my Soul.</i>

      <a name="philip_s" id="philip_s"></a>Sir <i>PHILIP SIDNEY</i>.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sir <i>Philip Sidney</i>, the glory of the <i>English</i> Nation
      in his time, and pattern of true Nobility, in whom the Graces and
      Muses had their domestical habitations, equally addicted both to
      Arts and Arms, though more fortunate in the one than in the
      other. Son to Sir <i>Henry Sidney</i>, thrice Lord Deputy of
      <i>Ireland</i>, and Sisters Son to <i>Robert</i> Earl of
      <i>Leicester</i>; Bred in <i>Christ</i>'s Church in
      <i>Oxford</i>, (<i>Cambridge</i> being nevertheless so happy to
      have a Colledge of his name) where he so profited in the Arts and
      Liberal Sciences, that after an incredible proficiency in all the
      Species of Learning, he left the Academical Life, for that of the
      Court, invited thither by his Uncle, the Earl of
      <i>Leicester</i>, that great Favourite of Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>.
      Here he so profited, that he became the glorious Star of his
      Family, a lively Pattern of Vertue, and the lovely Joy of all the
      learned sort. These his Parts so indeared him to Queen
      <i>Elizabeth</i>, that she sent him upon an Embassy to the
      Emperor of <i>Germany</i> at <i>Vienna</i>, which he discharged
      to his own Honour, and her Approbation. Yea, his Fame was so
      renowned throughout all Christendom, that (as it is commonly
      reported) he was in election for the Kingdom of <i>Poland</i>,
      though the Author of his Life, printed before his <i>Arcadia</i>,
      doth doubt of the truth of it, however it was not above his
      deserts.
    </p>
    <p>
      During his abode at the Court, at his spare hours he composed
      that incomparable Romance, entituled, <i>The Arcadia</i>, which
      he dedicated to his Sister the Countess of <i>Pembroke</i>. A
      Book (saith Dr. <i>Heylin</i>) which, besides its excellent
      Language, rare Contrivances, and delectable Stories, hath in it
      all the strains of Poesie, comprehendeth the whole art of
      speaking, and to them who can discern and will observe, affordeth
      notable Rules of Demeanour, both private and publick; and though
      some men, sharp-witted only in speaking evil, have depraved the
      Book, as the occasion that many precious hours are spent no
      better, they consider not that the ready way to make the minds of
      Youth grow awry, is to lace them too hard, by denying them just
      and due liberty. Surely (saith one) the Soul deprived of lawful
      delights, will, in way of revenge, (to enlarge its self out of
      prison) invade and attempt unlawful pleasures. Let such be
      condemned always to eat their meat with no other sawce, but their
      own appetite, who deprive themselves and others of those sallies
      into lawful Recreations, whereof no less plenty than variety is
      afforded in this <i>Arcadia</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      One writes, that Sir <i>Philip Sidney</i> in the extream agony of
      his wounds, so terrible the sence of death is, requested the
      dearest friend he had, to burn his <i>Arcadia</i>; what promise
      his friend returned herein is uncertain; but if he brake his word
      to be faithful to the publick good, posterity herein hath less
      cause to censure him for being guilty of such a meritorious
      offence, wherewith he hath obliged so many ages. Hereupon thus
      writeth the <i>British</i> Epigramatist.

      He wrote also besides his <i>Arcadia</i>, several other Works;
      namely, <i>A Defence of Poesie</i>, a Book entituled
      <i>Astrophel</i> and <i>Stella</i>, with divers Songs and Sonnets
      in praise of his Lady, whom he celebrated under that bright Name;
      whom afterwards he married, that Paragon of Nature, Sir
      <i>Francis Walsingham</i>'s Daughter, who impoverished himself to
      enrich the State; from whom he expected no more than what was
      above all Portions, a beautiful Wife, and a virtuous Daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He also translated part of that excellent Treatise of <i>Philip
      Morney du Plessis</i>, of the Truth of Religion; and no doubt had
      written many other excellent Works, had not the Lamp of his Life
      been extinguish'd too soon; the manner whereof take as followeth:
    </p>
    <p>
      His Unkle <i>Robert Dudley</i> Earl of <i>Leicester</i> (a man
      almost as much hated as his Nephew was loved) was sent over into
      the <i>Low-Countries</i>, with a well appointed Army, and large
      Commission, to defend the <i>United Provinces</i> against the
      <i>Spanish</i> Cruelty. Under him went Sir <i>Philip Sidney</i>,
      who had the Command of the cautionary Town of <i>Flushing</i>,
      and Castle of <i>Ramekius</i>, a Trust which he so faithfully
      discharged, that he turned the Envy of the <i>Dutch</i> Townsmen
      into Affection and Admiration. Not long after, some Service was
      to be performed nigh <i>Zutphen</i> in <i>Gueiderland</i>, where
      the <i>English</i>, through false intelligence, were mistaken in
      the strength of the Enemy. Sir <i>Philip</i> is employed next to
      the Chief in that Expedition; which he so discharged, that it is
      questionable whether his Wisdom, Industry or Valour may challenge
      to it self the greatest praise of the Action. And now when the
      triumphant Lawrels were ready to Crown his Brows, the
      <i>English</i> so near the Victory, that they touched it, ready
      to lay hold upon <ins class="correction" title=
      "Transcriber's note: 'it' was added.">it</ins>, he was
      unfortunately shot in the Thigh, which is the Rendez-vouz of
      Nerves and Sinews, which caused a Feaver, that proved so mortal,
      that five and twenty days after he died of the same; the Night of
      whose Death was the Noon of his Age, and the exceeding Loss of
      Christendom.
    </p>
    <p>
      His Body was conveyed into <i>England</i>, and most honourably
      interred in the Church of St. <i>Paul</i> in <i>London</i>; over
      which was fixed this Epitaph:
    </p>

        </div>

      To recite the Commendations given him by several Authors, would
      of it self require a Volume; to rehearse some few not unpleasing
      to the Reader. The reverend <i>Cambden</i> writes thus; This is
      that <i>Sidney</i>, whom, as God's will was, he should be
      therefore born into the world even to shew unto our Age a Sample
      of ancient Virtues. Doctor <i>Heylin</i> in his
      <i>Cosmography</i> calleth him, That gallant Gentleman of whom he
      cannot but make honourable mention. Mr. <i>Fuller</i> in his
      <i>Worthies</i> thus writes of him, His homebred Abilities
      perfected by Travel with foreign accomplishments, and a sweet
      Nature, set a gloss upon both. <i>Stow</i> in his <i>Annals</i>,
      calleth him, a most valiant and towardly Gentleman. <i>Speed</i>
      in his Chronicle, That worthy Gentleman in whom were compleat all
      Virtues and Valours that could be expected to reside in man: And
      Sir <i>Richard Baker</i> gives him this Character, A man of so
      many excellent parts of Art and Nature, of Valour and Learning,
      of Wit and Magnanimity, that as he had equalled all those of
      former Ages, so the future will hardly be able to equal him.

      Nor was this Poet forgotten by the Poets; who offered whole
      Hecatombs of Verses in his praise. Hear first that Kingly Poet,
      or Poetical King, King <i>James</i> the first, late Monarch of

      <a name="fulk_g" id="fulk_g"></a>Sir <i>FULK GREVIL</i>.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Next to Sir <i>Philip Sidney</i>, we shall add his great Friend
      and Associate, Sir <i>Fulk Grevil</i>, Lord <i>Brook</i>, one
      very eminent both for Arts and Arms; to which the <i>genius</i>
      of that time did mightily invite active Spirits. This Noble
      Person, for the great love he bore to Sir <i>Philip Sidney</i>,
      wrote his Life. He wrote several other Works both in Prose and
      Verse, some of which were Dramatick, as his Tragedies of
      <i>Alaham</i>, <i>Mustapha</i>, and <i>Marcus Tallius Cicero</i>,
      and others, commonly of a Political Subject; amongst which, a
      Posthume Work, not publish'd till within a few years, being a
      two-fold Treatise, the first of Monarchy, the second of Religion,
      in all which is observable a close mysterious and sententious way
      of Writing, without much regard to Elegancy of Stile, or
      smoothness of Verse. Another Posthume Book is also fathered upon
      him; namely, <i>The Five Years of King</i> James, <i>or the
      Condition of the State of</i> England, <i>and the Relation it had
      to other Provinces</i>, Printed in the Year 1643. But of this
      last Work many people are doubtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now for his Abilities in the Exercise of Arms, take this
      instance: At such time when the <i>French</i> Ambassadours came
      over into <i>England</i>, to Negotiate a Marriage between the
      Duke of <i>Anjou</i>, and Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>, for their
      better entertainment, Solemn Justs were proclaimed, where the
      Earl of <i>Arundel, Frederick</i> Lord <i>Windsor</i>, Sir
      <i>Philip Sidney</i>, and he, were chief Challengers against all
      comers; in which Challenge he behaved himself so gallantly, that
      he won the reputation of a most valiant Knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus you see, that though <i>Ease be the Nurse of Poesie</i>, the
      Muses are also Companions to <i>Mars</i>, as may be exemplified
      in the Lives of the Earl of <i>Surrey</i>, Sir <i>Philip
      Sidney</i>, and this Sir <i>Falk Grevil</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall only add a word or two of his death, Which was as sad as
      lamentable. He kept a discontented servant, who conceiving his
      deserts, not soon or well enough rewarded, wounded him mortally;
      and then (to save the Law a labour) killed himself. Verifying
      therein the observation, <i>That there is none who never so much
      despiseth his own life, but yet is master of another mans</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This ingenious Gentleman, (in whose person shined all true Vertue
      and high Nobility) as he was a great friend to learning himself,
      so was he a great favourer of learning in others, witness his
      liberality to Mr. <i>Speed</i> the Chronologer, when finding his
      wide Soul was stuffed with too narrow an Occupation, gave it
      enlargement, as the said Author doth ingeniously confess in his
      description of <i>Warwickshire, Whose Merits</i> (saith he) <i>to
      me-ward, I do acknowledge, in setting <ins class="correction"
      title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'his'">this</ins> hand
      free from the daily employments of a Manual Trade, and giving it
      full liberty thus to express the inclination of <ins class=
      "correction" title="Transcriber's note: 'my' was added">my</ins>
      mind, himself being the</i> Procurer <i>of my present Estate</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lieth interred in <i>Warwick</i> Church, under a Monument of
      Black and White Marble, wherein he is styled, <i>Servant to
      Queen</i> Elizabeth, <i>Counsellor to King</i> James, <i>and
      Friend to</i> Sir <i><ins class="correction" title=
      "Transcriber's note: possibly 'Philip'">Philp</ins> Sidney</i>.
      He died <i>Anno 16&mdash;.</i> without Issue, save only those of
      his Brain, which will make his Name to live, when others Issue
      they may fail them.

      <a name="edmund_s" id="edmund_s"></a>Mr. <i>EDMOND SPENSER</i>.
    </h2>
    <p>
      This our Famous Poet, Mr. <i>Edmond Spenser</i>, was born in the
      City of <i>London</i>, and brought up in <i>Pembroke-Hall</i> in
      <i>Cambridge</i>; where he became a most excellent Scholar, but
      especially very happy in <i>English</i> Poetry, as his learned,
      elaborate Works do declare, which whoso shall peruse with a
      judicious eye, will find to have in them the very height of
      Poetick fancy, and though some blame his Writings for the many
      <i>Chaucerisms</i> used by him, yet to the Learned they are known
      not to be blemishes, but rather beauties to his Book; which,
      notwithstanding, (saith a learned Writer) had been more salable,
      if more conformed to our modern language.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first flight in Poetry, as not thinking himself fully
      fledged, was in that Book of his, called <i>The Shepherds
      Kalendar</i>, applying an old Name to a new Book; It being of
      Eclogues fitted to each Month in the Year: of which Work hear
      what that worthy Knight, Sir <i>Philip Sidney</i> writes, whose
      judgment in such cases is counted infallible: <i>The Shepherds
      Kalendar</i> (saith he) <i>hath much Poetry in his Eclogues,
      indeed worthy the reading, if I be not deceived; That same
      framing his Stile to an old rustick Language, I dare not allow,
      since neither</i> Theocritus <i>in</i> Greek, Virgil <i>in</i>
      Latine, <i>nor</i> Sanazara <i>in</i> Italian <i>did effect
      it</i>. Afterwards he translated the <i>Gnat</i>, a little
      fragment of <i>Virgil's</i> excellency. Then he translated
      <i>Bellay</i> his Ruins of <i>Rome</i>; His most unfortunate Work
      was that of <i>Mother Hubbard's Tale</i>, giving therein offence
      to one in authority, who afterwards stuck on his skirts. But his
      main Book, and which indeed I think Envy its self cannot carp at,
      was his <i>Fairy Queen</i>, a Work of such an ingenious composure
      as will last as long as time endures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now as you have heard what esteem Sir <i>Philip</i> <i>Sidney</i>
      had of his Book, so you shall hear what esteem Mr. <i>Spenser</i>
      had of Sir <i>Philip Sidney</i>, writing thus in his <i>Ruins of
      Time</i>.

      There passeth a story commonly told and believed, that Mr.
      <i>Spenser</i> presenting his Poems to Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>,
      she highly affected therewith, commanded the Lord <i>Cecil</i>,
      her Treasurer, to give him an Hundred Pound; and when the
      Treasurer (a good Steward of the Queen's Money) alledged, that
      Sum was too much for such a matter; then give him, quoth the
      Queen, <i>what is reason</i>; but was so busied, or seemed to be
      so, about matters of higher concernment, that Mr. <i>Spenser</i>
      received no reward: whereupon he presented this Petition in a
      small piece of Paper to the Queen in her progress.

      payment of the hundred pounds she first intended him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He afterwards went over into <i>Ireland</i>, Secretary to the
      Lord <i>Gray</i>, Lord Deputy thereof; and though that his Office
      under his Lord was lucrative, yet got he no Estate; <i>Peculiari
      Poetis fato semper cum paupertate conflictatus est</i>, saith the
      reverend <i>Cambden</i>; so that it fared little better with him,
      (than with <i>Churchyard</i> or <i>Tusser</i> before him) or with
      <i>William Xiliander</i> the <i>German</i>, (a most excellent
      Linguist, Antiquary, Philosopher, and Mathematician) who was so
      poor, that (as <i>Thuanus</i> writes) he was thought, <i>Fami non
      famæ scribere</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thriving so bad in that boggy Country, to add to his misery, he
      was robb'd by the Rebels of that little he had left; whereupon,
      in great grief, he returns into <i>England</i>, and falling into
      want, which to a noble spirit is most killing, being heartbroken,
      he died <i>Anno</i> 1598. and was honourably buried at the sole
      charge of <i>Robert</i>, first of that name Earl of <i>Essex</i>,

      A modern Author writes, that the Lord <i>Cecil</i> owed Mr.
      <i>Spenser</i> a grudge for some Reflections of his in <i>Mother
      Hubbard's Tale</i>, and therefore when the Queen had order'd him
      that Money, the Lord Treasurer said, What all this for a Song?
      And this he is said to have taken so much to heart, that he
      contracted a deep Melancholy, which soon after brought his life
      to a period: so apt is an ingenious spirit to resent a slighting
      even from the greatest persons. And thus much I must needs say of
      the Merit of so great a Poet, from so great a Monarch, that it is
      incident to the best of Poets sometimes to flatter some Royal or
      Noble Patron, never did any do it more to the height, or with
      greater art and elegance, if the highest of praises attributed to
      so Heroick a Princess can justly be termed flattery.

      in that County. His Father, for carrying a Letter to the Lady
      (afterwards Queen) <i>Elizabeth</i>, was kept twelve months in
      the <i>Tower</i>, and made to spend a Thousand Pounds e're he
      could be free of that trouble. His Mother also being Servant to
      the Lady <i>Elizabeth</i>, was sequestred from her, and her
      Husband enjoyned not to keep company with her; so that on both
      sides he may be said to be very indear'd to Queen

      <i>Still</i> his Tutor. He afterwards proved one of the most

      Estates, applied herself wholly to him, accommodating him with
      all necessaries, and preventing his asking any thing with her
      officiousness. She being demanded by him, the reason of her so
      careful waiting on him? <i>I understand</i> (said she) <i>you are
      a very witty man, and if I should displease you in any thing, I

      Sir <i>John</i> frequenting often the Lady <i>Robert</i>'s House,

      not to lie unto God, for here we never have our Meat in due

      <a name="thomas_o" id="thomas_o"></a>Sir <i>THOMAS OVERBURY</i>.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sir <i>Thomas Overbury</i>, a Knight and Wit, was Son to Sir
      <i>Nicholas Overbury</i> of <i>Burton</i> in
      <i>Glocester-shire</i>, one of the Judges of the Marches; who, to
      his natural propension of ingenuity, had the addition of good
      Education, being bred up first in <i>Oxford</i>, afterwards, for
      a while a Student of the Law in the <i>Middle Temple</i>; soon
      after he cast Anchor at Court, the Haven of Hope for all aspiring
      Spirits; afterwards travell'd into <i>France</i>, where having
      been some time, he returned again, and was entertained into the
      respects of Sir <i>Rob. Carre</i>, one who was newly initiated a
      Favourite to King <i>James</i>; where, by his wise carriage, he
      purchased to himself not only the good affection and respect of
      Sir <i>Robert</i>, but also of divers other eminent persons.
    </p>
    <p>
      During his abode with Sir <i>Robert Carre</i>, he composed that
      excellent Poem of his, entituled, <i>A Wife</i>; which, for the
      excellency thereof, the Author of the Epistle to the Reader,
      prefixed before his Book, thus writes, <i>Had such a Poem been
      extant among the ancient</i> Romans, <i>altho' they wanted our
      easie conservation of Wit by Printing, they would have committed
      it to Brass, lest injurious time might deprive it of due
      eternity</i>. Nor was his Poem of <i>A Wife</i> not only done to
      the life, but also those Characters which he wrote, to this day
      not out-witted by any.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to return from the Work to the Workman; Mr. <i>Overbury</i>
      is by the King knighted, and Sir <i>Rob. Carre</i> made a
      Viscount, and such a reciprocal Love pass'd betwixt them, that it
      was questionable, whether the Viscount were more in favour with
      King <i>James</i>, or Sir <i>Thomas Overbury</i> in the favour of
      the Viscount? But what estate on earth is so firm, that is not
      changeable, or what friendship is so constant, that is not
      dissolvable? Who would imagine this Viscount should be
      instrumental to his death, who had done him so faithful service,
      and to whom he had embosom'd his most secret thoughts? Yet so it
      was, for Sir <i>Thomas</i>, out of an unfeigned affection which
      he bare to the Viscount, diswaded him from a motion of a Marriage
      which was propounded betwixt him and the Lady <i>Francis
      Howard</i>, who was lately divorced from the Earl of
      <i>Essex</i>, as a Match neither for his credit here, nor comfort
      hereafter. This Counsel, though it proceeded from an unfeigned
      love in Sir <i>Thomas</i>, yet where Beauty commands, all
      discretion being sequestred, created in the Viscount a hatred
      towards him; and in the Countess the fury of a woman, a desire of
      revenge, who perswaded the Viscount, <i>That it was not possible
      that ever she should endure those injuries, or hope for any
      prosperity so long as he lived; That she wondred how he could be
      so familiar, so much affected to his man</i> Overbury; <i>that
      without him he could do nothing, as it were making him his right
      hand, seeing he being newly grown into the Kings favour, and
      depending wholly upon his greatness, must expect to be clouded if
      not ruined, when his servant that knew his secrets should come to
      preferment.</i> The Viscount, apt enough of his own inclination
      to revenge, being thus further exasperated by the Countess, they
      joyntly resolve upon his death, and soon a fit opportunity came
      to their hands. He being by King <i>James</i> (and as it is
      thought by the Viscount's Counsel) nominated to be sent
      Embassador to the Emperor of <i>Russia</i>, was by the said
      Viscount, whom he especially trusted, persuaded to decline the
      employment, as no better than an <i>honourable Grave</i>; Better
      lie some days in the <i>Tower</i>, than more months in a worse
      Prison; a Ship by Sea, and a barbarous cold Country by Land.
      <i>You are now</i> (Said he) <i>in credit at home, and have made
      tryal of the dangers of travel, why then should you hazard all
      upon uncertainties, being already in possession of that you can
      probably expect by these means</i>; promising him, that within a
      small time he would so work with the King, that he should have a
      good of opinion him. But he (saith Dr. <i>Fuller</i>) who
      willingly goes into a Prison out of hope to come easily out of
      it, may stay therein so long till he be too late convinced of his
      error.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now having him in the place where they would, their next
      study to secure their revenge, was closely to make him away;
      which they concluded to be by poyson. To this end, they consult
      with one Mrs. <i>Turner</i> (the first inventer of that horrid
      Garb of yellow Ruffs and Cuffs, and in which Garb she was after
      hanged) she having acquaintance with one <i>James Franklin</i>, a
      man skilled for that purpose, agreed with him to provide that
      which should not kill presently, but cause one to languish away
      by degrees, a little and a little. Sir <i>Gervas Yelvis</i>,
      Lieutenant of the Tower, being drawn into the Conspiracy, admits
      one <i>Weston</i>, Mrs. <i>Turners</i> man, who under pretence of
      waiting upon Sir <i>Thomas</i>, was to act the horrid Tragedy.
      The Plot thus continued, <i>Franklin</i> buyes certain Poysons,
      <i>viz. Sosater</i>, <i>white Arsenic</i>, <i>Mercury
      sublimate</i>, <i>Cantharides</i>, red <i>Mercury</i>, with three
      or four other deadly Ingredients, which he delivered to
      <i>Weston</i>, with instructions how to use them. <i>Weston</i>,
      (an apt Scholar in the Devil's School) tempers them in his Broth
      and Meat, increasing or diminishing their strength according as
      he saw him affected. Besides these, poyson'd Tarts &amp; Jellies
      are sent him by the Viscount. Nay, they poysoned his very Salt,
      Sauce, Meat and Drink; but being of a very strong Constitution,
      he held out still: At last they effected their work by a poysoned
      Clyster which they administed unto him, so that the next day he
      died thereof; and because there were some Blisters and ugly
      Botches on his Body, the Conspirators gave it out he died of the
      <i>French Pox</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus by the Malice of a Woman this worthy Knight was murdered,
      who yet still lives in that witty Poem of his, entituled, <i>a
      Wife</i>; as is well expressed by these Verses under his Picture.

    <p>
      But God, who seldom suffers Murder to go unrevenged, revealed the
      same; for notwithstanding what the Conspirators had given out,
      Suspitions grew high that Sir <i>Thomas</i> was poysoned:
      Whereupon <i>We port</i> is examined by the Lord <i>Cook</i>, who
      at first flatly denied the same; but being perswaded by the
      Bishop of <i>London</i>, he tells all: How Mrs. <i>Turner</i> and
      the Countess came acquainted; what relation she had to Witches,
      Sorcerers and Conjurers; and discovers all those who had any hand
      in it: whereupon they were all apprehended; some sent to the
      <i>Tower</i>, others to <i>Newgate</i>. Having thus confessed,
      being convicted according to course of Law, he was hanged at
      <i>Tyburn</i>; after him Mrs. <i>Turner</i>, after her
      <i>Franklin</i>, then Sir <i>Gervas Yelvis</i>, upon their
      several Arraignments, were found guilty, and executed. Some of
      them died very penitent: The Earl and his Countess were both
      condemned, but through the King's gracious Pardon had their Lives
      saved, but were never admitted to the Favour of the Court.

    <div class="poem">

        </div>
        <div>

        </div>
        <div>

        </div>

      </div>

    <p>
      However, in the esteem of the more curious of these times, his
      Works seem to be antiquated, especially this of his
      <i>Poly-Olbion</i> because of the old-fashion'd kind of Verse
      thereof, which seems somewhat to diminish that respect which was
      formerly paid to the Subject, although indeed both pleasant and
      elaborate, wherein he took a great deal both of study and pains;
      and thereupon thought worthy to be commented upon by that once
      walking Library of our Nation, Mr. <i>John Selden</i>: His
      <i>Barons Wars</i> are done to the Life, equal to any of that
      Subject. His <i>Englands Heroical Epistles</i> generally liked
      and received, entituling him unto the appellation of the
      <i>English Ovid</i>. His Legends of <i>Robert</i> Duke of
      <i>Normandy</i>. <i>Matilda</i>, <i>Pierce Gaveston</i>, and
      <i>Thomas Cromwel</i>, all of them done to the Life. His
      <i>Idea</i> expresses much Fancy and Poetry. And to such as love
      that Poetry, that of <i>Nymphs</i> and <i>Shepherds</i>, his
      <i>Nymphals</i>, and other things of that nature, cannot be
      unpleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      To conclude, He was a Poet of a pious temper, his Conscience
      having always the command of his Fancy; very temperate in his
      Life, flow of speech, and inoffensive in company. He changed his
      Lawrel for a Crown of Glory, <i>Anno</i> 1631. and was buried in
      <i>Westminster-Abbey</i>, near the South-door, by those two
      eminent Poets, <i>Geoffry Chaucer</i> and <i>Edmond Spencer</i>,
      with this Epitaph made (as it is said) by Mr. <i>Benjamin
      Johnson</i>.

      <a name="samuel_d" id="samuel_d"></a>Mr. <i>SAMUEL DANIEL</i>.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. <i>Daniel</i> was born nigh to the Town of <i>Taunton</i> in
      <i>Somersetshire</i>; his Father was a Master of Musick, and his
      harmonious Mind (saith Dr. <i>Fuller</i>) made an impression in
      his Son's Genius, who proved to be one of the Darlings of the
      Muses, a most excellent Poet, whose Wings of Fancy displayed the
      Flags of highest Invention: Carrying in his <i>Christian</i> and
      <i>Sirname</i> the Names of two holy Prophets; which, as they
      were Monitors to him, for avoyding Scurrility, so he qualified
      his Raptures to such a strain, as therein he abhorred all
      Debauchery and Prophaneness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was he only one of the inspired Train of <i>Phoebus</i>, but
      also a most judicious Historian, witness his Lives of our
      <i>English</i> Kings since the Conquest, until King <i>Edward</i>
      the Third, wherein he hath the happiness to reconcile brevity
      with clearness, qualities of great distance in other Authors; and
      had he continued to these times, no doubt it had been a Work
      incomparable: Of which his Undertaking, Dr. <i>Heylin</i> in the
      Preface to his <i>Cosmography</i>, gives this Character, speaking
      of the chiefest Historians of this Nation; <i>And to end the
      Bed-roll</i> (says he) <i>half the Story of this Realm done by
      Mr.</i> Daniel, <i>of which I believe that which himself saith of
      it in his Epistle to the Reader, that there was never brought
      together more of the Main</i>. Which Work is since commendably
      continued (but not with equal quickness and judgment,) by Mr.
      <i>Truffel</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for his Poems so universally received, the first in esteem is,
      that Heroical one of the Civil Wars between the two Houses of
      <i>York</i> and <i>Lancaster</i>; of which the elaborate Mr.
      <i>Speed</i>, in his Reign of <i>Richard</i> the Second, thus
      writes: <i>The Seeds</i> (saith he) <i>of those fearful
      Calamities, a flourishing Writer of our Age</i> (speaking of Mr.
      <i>Daniel</i>) <i>willing nearly to have imitated</i> Lucan,
      <i>as he is indeed called our</i> English Lucan, <i>doth not
      unfortunately express, tho' he might rather have said he wept
      them, than sung them; but indeed so to sing them, is to weep

      Next, take notice of his <i>Musophilus</i>, or general Defence of

      <i>Octovia</i> to <i>Marcus Antonius</i>, his Complaint of
      <i>Rosamond</i> his <i>Panegyrick</i>, <i>Delia</i>,
      <i>&amp;c.</i> Besides his <i>Dramatick</i> Pieces; as his
      Tragedy of <i>Philotus</i> and <i>Cleopatra</i>; <i>Hymenis
      Triumph</i>, and the <i>Queens Arcadia</i>, a Pastoral; being all
      of them of such worth, that they were well accepted by the
      choicest Judgments of those Times, and do yet remain in good
      esteem, as by their often Impressions may appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      This our Poet's deserts preferr'd him to be a Servant in ordinary
      to Queen <i>Anne</i>, the most illustrious wife of King
      <i>James</i> I. who allowed him a fair Salary, such as enabled
      him to keep a handsom Gardenhouse in <i>Old-street</i> nigh
      <i>London</i>, where he would commonly lie obscure sometimes two
      Months together, the better to enjoy that great Felicity he aimed
      at, by enjoying the company of the <i>Muses</i>, and then would
      appear in publick, to recreate himself, and converse with his
      Friends; of whom the most endeared were the Learned Doctor
      <i>Cowel</i>, and Judicious Mr. <i>Cambden</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now being weary of the Troubles of the City and Court, he
      retired into the Country, and turn'd Husbandman, Renting a Farm
      or Grange in <i>Wiltshire</i> nigh the <i>Devizes</i>, not so
      much, as it is thought, for the hope of gains, as to enjoy the
      retiredness of a Country Life: How he thrived upon it, I cannot
      inform my self, much less my Readers, although no question
      pleasing himself therein, he attained to that Riches he sought
      for, <i>viz.</i> Quiet and Contentedness; which whoso enjoys,
      reapeth benefit of his labours. He left no Issue behind him but
      those of his Brain, though living a good space of time with
      <i>Justina</i> his wife: For his Estate, he had neither a
      <i>Bank</i> of Wealth, nor <i>Lank</i> of Want; but living in a
      competent contented condition, and died (as it is conjectured)
      about the latter end of King <i>James</i> I.

      <i>George Chapman</i> was one in his time much famed for the
      Fluency of his Muse; gaining a great repute for his Translation
      of <i>Homer</i> and <i>Hesiod</i>, which in those times passed as
      Works done without compare; and indeed considering he was one of
      the first who brake the Ice in the Translation of such learned
      Authors, reading the highest conception of their Raptures into a
      neat polite <i>English</i>, as gave the true meaning of what they
      intended, and rendred it a style acceptable to the Reader;
      considering, I say, what Age he lived in, it was very well worthy
      praise; though since the Translation of <i>Homer</i> is very far
      out-done by Mr. <i>Ogilby</i>. He also continued that excellent
      Poem of <i>Hero</i> and <i>Leander</i>, begun by <i>Christopher

      his Dramatick Writings; as his <i>Blind Beggar</i> of

      The Poetical Fiction of <i>Briareus</i> the Giant, who had an
      hundred hands, found a Moral in him, who could so cunningly and
      copiously disguise his aforesaid elemental hands, that by mixing,
      he could make them appear an hundred; and if not so many sorts,
      so many degrees of writing. He had also many pretty excursions
      into Poetry, and could flourish Matters as well as Letters, with
      his Fancy as well as with his Pen. Take a taste of his Abilities
      in those Verses of his before <i>Coriat's Crudities</i>, being
      called the <i>Odcombian Banquet</i>, wherein the whole Club of
      Wits in that Age joyned together, to write Mock-commendatory
      Verses in <i>Praise-dispraise</i> of his Book.

      <a name="john_do" id="john_do"></a>Doctor <i>JOHN DONNE</i>.
    </h2>
    <p>
      This pleasant Poet, painful Preacher, and pious Person, was born
      in <ins class="correction" title=
      "Transcriber's note: original reads 'Dondon'"><i>London</i></ins>,
      of wealthy Parents, who took such care of his Education, that at
      nine years of Age he was sent to study at <i>Hart-Hall</i> in
      <i>Oxford</i>, having besides the <i>Latine</i> and <i>Greek</i>,
      attained to a knowledge in the <i>French</i> Tongue. Here he fell
      into acquaintance with that great Master of Language and Art, Sir
      <i>Henry Wootton</i>; betwixt whom was such Friendship
      contracted, that nothing but Death could force the separation.
    </p>
    <p>
      From <i>Oxford</i> he was transplanted to <i>Cambridge</i>, where
      he much improved his Study, and from thence placed at <i>Lincolns
      Inn</i>, when his Father dying, and leaving him three thousand
      pound in ready Money; he having a youthful desire to travel, went
      over with the Earl of <i>Essex</i> to <i>Cales</i>; where having
      seen the issue of this Expedition, he left them and went into
      <i>Italy</i>, and from thence into <i>Spain</i>, where by his
      industry he attained to a perfection in their Languages, and
      returned home with many useful Observations of those Countries,
      and their Laws and Government.
    </p>
    <p>
      These his Abilities, upon his Return, preferred him to be
      Secretary to the Lord <i>Elsmore</i>, Keeper of the Great Seal;
      in whose Service he fell in Love with a young Gentlewoman who
      lived in that Family, Neece to the Lady <i>Elsmore</i>, and
      Daughter to Sir <i>George Moor</i>, Chancellor of the Garter, and
      Lieutenant of the Tower, who greatly opposed this Match; yet
      notwithstanding they were privately married: which so exasperated
      Sir <i>George Moor</i>, that he procured the Lord <i>Elsmore</i>
      to discharge him of his Secretariship, and never left prosecuting
      him till he had cast him into Prison, as also his two Friends who
      had married him, and gave him his Wife in Marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr.<i>Donne</i> had not been long there before he found means
      to get out, as also enlargement for his two Friends, and soon
      after through the mediation of some able persons, a
      reconciliation was made, and he receiving a Portion with his
      Wife, and having help of divers friends, they lived very
      comfortably together; And now was he frequently visited by men of
      greatest learning and judgment in this Kingdom; his company
      desired by the Nobility, and extreamly affected by the Gentry:
      His friendship was sought for of most foreign Embassadors, and
      his acquaintance entreated by many other strangers, whose
      learning or employment occasioned their stay in this
      <i>Kingdom</i>. In which state of life he composed his <i>more
      brisk</i> and <i>youthful Poems</i>; in which he was so happy, as
      if Nature with all her varieties had been made to exercise his
      <i>great Wit</i> and <i>Fancy</i>; Nor did he leave it off in his
      <i>old age</i>, as is witnessed by many of his <i>divine
      Sonnets</i>, and other <i>high, holy</i> and <i>harmonious
      Composures</i>, under his <i>Effigies</i> in these following
      Verses to his Printed Poems, one most ingeniously expresses.

      At last, by King <i>James's</i> his command, or rather earnest
      persuasion, setting himself to the study of <i>Theology</i>, and
      into <i>holy Orders</i>, he was first made a Preacher of
      <i>Lincoln's-Inn</i>, afterwards advanc'd to be Dean of
      <i>Pauls</i>, and as of an eminent Poet he became a much more
      eminent Preacher, so he rather improved then relinquisht his
      Poetical fancy, only con converting it from <i>humane and
      worldly</i> to <i>divine and heavenly Subjects</i>; witness this

      as <i>Alexander</i> the great did to the Grave of the most famous
      <i>Achilles</i>, so they strewed his with curious and costly
      flowers. Nor was this (tho' not usual) all the honour done to his

      He from a Student in, became Dean of <i>Christchurch</i>, then
      Bishop of <i>Oxford</i>, being of a courteous carriage, and no
      destructive nature to any who offended him, counting himself
      plentifully repaired with a Jest upon him. He afterwards was
      advanced Bishop of <i>Norwich</i>, where he died <i>Anno</i>
      1635.

    <p>
      This <i>renowned Poet</i>, whose Fame surmounts all the Elogies
      which the most learned Pen can bestow upon him, was born in the
      City of <i>Westminster</i>, his Mother living there in
      <i>Harts-horn-lane</i>, near <i>Charing-cross</i>, where she
      married a <i>Bricklayer</i> for her second Husband. He was first
      bred in a private School in St. <i>Martin's</i>-Church, then in
      <i>Westminster</i>-School, under the learned Mr. <i>Cambden</i>,
      as he himself intimates in one of his Epigrams.

          <i>Cambden</i>, most reverend head, to whom I owe
        </div>
        <div>
          All that I am in Arts, all that I know.
        </div>
        <div>
          How nothings that, to whom my Country owes,

      Under this <i>learned Schoolmaster</i> he attained to a good
      degree of learning, and was statutably admitted in St.
      <i>John's</i>-Colledge in <i>Cambridge</i>, (as many years after
      incorporated a honorary Member of <i>Christ-Church</i> in
      <i>Oxford</i>) here he staid but some small time, for want of
      maintainance; for if there be no Oyl in the Lamp, it will soon be
      extinguish'd: And now, as if he had quite laid aside all thoughts
      of the University, he betook himself to the Trade of his
      Father-in-law; And let not any be offended herewith, since it is
      more commendable to work in a lawful Calling, then having one not
      to use it. He was one who helped in the building of the new
      Structure of <i>Lincolns-Inn</i>, where, having a Trowel in his
      hand, he had a Book in his pocket, that as his work went forward,
      so his study went not backward.
    </p>
    <p>
      But such <i>rare Parts</i> as he had could be no more hid, than
      the Sun in a serene day, some Gentlemen pitying such rare
      Endowments should be buried under the rubbish of so mean a
      Calling, did by their bounty manumise him freely to follow his
      own ingenious inclinations. Indeed his Parts were not so ready to
      run of themselves, as able to answer the spur; so that it may be
      truly said of him, that he had an elaborate wit wrought out by
      his own industry; yet were his Repartees for the most part very
      quick and smart, and which favour'd much of ingenuity, of which I
      shall give you two instances.
    </p>
    <p>
      He having been drinking in an upper room, at the
      <i>Feathers</i>-Tavern in <i>Cheap side</i>, as he was coming
      down stairs, his foot slipping, he caught a fall, and tumbling
      against a door, beat it open into a room where some Gentlemen
      were drinking <i>Canary</i>; recovering his feet, he said,
      <i>Gentlemen, since I am so luckily fallen into your company, I
      will drink with you before I go</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      He used very much to frequent the <i>Half-Moon</i>-Tavern in
      <i>Aldersgate-street</i>, through which was a common <i>Thorough
      fare</i>; he coming late that way, one night, was denied passage,
      whereupon going through the <i>Sun</i>-Tavern a little after, he
      said,

      His constant humour was to sit silent in learned Company, and
      suck in (besides Wine) their several Humours into his
      observation; what was <i>Ore</i> in others, he was able to refine

      He was paramount in the Dramatick part of Poetry, and taught the
      Stage an exact conformity to the Laws of Comedians, being
      accounted the most learned, judicious, and correct of them all,
      and the more to be admired for being so, for that neither the
      height of natural parts, for he was no <i>Shakespear</i>, nor the
      cost of extraordinary education, but his own proper industry, and
      addiction to Books, advanced him to this perfection. He wrote
      fifty Plays in all, whereof fifteen Comedies, three Tragedies,
      the rest Masques and Entertainments. His Comedies were, <i>The
      Alchimist</i>, <i>Bartholomew Fair</i>, <i>Cynthia's Revels</i>,
      <i>Caseis alter'd</i>, <i>The Devil is an Ass</i>, <i>Every Man
      in his humour, every Man out of his humour</i>, <i>The Fox</i>,
      <i>Magnetick Lady</i>, <i>New Inn</i>, <i>Poetaster</i>,
      <i>Staple of News</i>, <i>Sad Shepherd, Silent Woman</i>, and
      <i>A Tale of a Tub</i>. His Tragedies were, <i>Cateline's
      Conspiracy, Mortimer's Fall</i>, and <i>Seianus</i>. His Masques
      and Entertainments, too long here to write, were thirty and two,
      besides a Comedy of <i>East-ward, hoe</i>? in which he was
      partner with <i>Chapman</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      These his Plays were above the vulgar capacity, (which are onely
      tickled with down-right obscenity) and took not so well at the
      first <i>stroke</i>, as at the <i>rebound</i>, when beheld the
      second time, yea, they will endure reading, and that with due
      commendation, so long as either ingenuity or learning are
      fashionable in our Nation. And although all his Plays may endure
      the test, yet in three of his Comedies, namely, <i>The Fox,
      Alchymist</i>, and <i>Silent Woman</i>, he may be compared in the
      judgment of the learned men, for <i>decorum, language</i> and
      <i>well-humouring</i> parts, as well with the chief of the
      ancient <i>Greek</i> and <i>Latine</i> Comedians, as the prime of
      modern <i>Italians</i>, who have been judged the best of
      <i>Europe</i> for a happy vein in Comedies; nor is his
      <i>Bartholomew Fair</i> much short of them. As for his other
      Comedies, <i>Staple of News, Devil's an Ass</i>, and the rest, if
      they be not so sprightful and vigorous as his first pieces, all
      that are old will, and all that desire to be old, should excuse
      him therein; and therefore let the Name of <i>Ben Johnson</i>
      sheild them against whoever shall think fit to be severe in
      censure against them. Truth is, his Tragedies, <i>Seianus and
      Cateline</i> seem to have in them more of an artificial and
      inflate, than of a pathetical and naturally Tragick height; yet
      do they every one of them far excel any of the <i>English</i>
      ones that were writ before him; so that he may be truly said to
      be the first reformer of the <i>English</i> Stage, as he himself
      more truly than modestly writes in his commendatory Verses of his
      Servants <i>Richard Broom</i>'s Comedy of the <i>Northern
      Lass</i>.

      In the rest of his Poetry, (for he is not wholly Dramatick) as
      his <i>Underwoods</i>, <i>Epigrams</i>, &amp;c. he is sometimes

      full enough of conceit, and sometimes a man as other men are.

      These two joyned together, made one of the happy
      <i>Triumvirate</i> (the other two being <i>Johnson</i> and
      <i>Shakespear</i>) of the chief Dramatick Poets of our Nation, in
      the last foregoing Age; among whom there might be said to be a
      symmetry of perfection, while each excelled in his peculiar way:
      <i>Ben Johnson</i> in his elaborate pains and knowledge of
      Authors, <i>Shakespear</i> in his pure vein of wit, and natural
      Poetick height; <i>Fletcher</i> in a Courtly Elegance and Gentile
      Familiarity of Style, and withal a Wit and Invention so
      overflowing, that the luxuriant Branches thereof were frequently
      thought convenient to be lopt off by Mr. <i>Beaumont</i>; which
      two joyned together, like <i>Castor</i> and <i>Pollux</i>, (most
      happy when in conjunction) raised the <i>English</i> to equal the

    </p>
    <p>
      These two admirable Wits wrote in all two and fifty Plays,
      whereof three and forty were Comedies; namely, <i>Beggars
      Bush</i>, <i>Custom of the Country</i>, <i>Captain Coxcomb</i>,
      <i>Chances</i>, <i>Cupid's Revenge</i>, <i>Double Marriage</i>,
      <i>Elder Brother</i>, <i>Four Plays in one</i>, <i>Fair Maid of

    <p>
      It is reported of them, that meeting once in a Tavern, to
      contrive the rude Draught of a Tragedy, <i>Fletcher</i> undertook
      to <i>kill the King</i> therein, whose Words being over-heard by
      a Listner (though his Loyalty not to be blamed herein) he was
      accused of High Treason, till the Mistake soon appearing, that
      the Plot was only against a Dramatick and Scenical King, all
      wound off in Merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet were not these two Poets so conjoyned, but that each of them
      did several Pieces by themselves, Mr. <i>Beaumont</i>, besides
      other Works, wrote a Poem, entituled, <i>Salmacis</i> and
      <i>Hermaphroditus</i>, a Fable taken out of <i>Ovid's
      Metamorphosis</i>; and Mr. <i>Fletcher</i> surviving Mr.
      <i>Beamont</i>, wrote good Comedies of himself; so that it could
      not be laid to his Charge what <i>Ajax</i> doth to

      <a name="william_s" id="william_s"></a><i>WILLIAM SHAKESPEAR</i>.
    </h2>
    <p>
      This eminent Poet, the Glory of the <i>English</i> Stage (and so
      much the more eminent, that he gained great applause and
      commendation, when able Wits were his Contemporaries) was born at
      <i>Stratford</i> upon <i>Avon</i> in <i>Warwickshire</i>, and is
      the highest honour that Town can boast of. He was one of the
      <i>Triumvirate</i>, who from Actors, became Makers of Comedies
      and Tragedies, <i>viz. Christopher Marlow</i> before him, and Mr.
      <i>John Lacy</i>, since his time, and one in whom three eminent
      Poets may seem in some sort to be compounded, 1. <i>Martial</i>,
      in the warlike sound of his Sirname, <i>Hastivibrans</i>, or
      <i>Shakespear</i>; whence some have supposed him of military
      extraction. 2. <i>Ovid</i>, the most natural and witty of all
      Poets; and hence it was that Queen <i>Elizabeth</i> coming into a
      Grammar-School, made this extemporary Verse.
    </p>
    <div class="poem">

          <i>Ovid</i> a fine Wag.
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      3. <i>Plautus</i>, a most exact Comedian, and yet never any
      Scholar, as our <i>Shakespear</i> (if alive) would confess
      himself; but by keeping company with Learned persons, and
      conversing with jocular Wits, whereto he was naturally inclin'd,
      he became so famously witty, or wittily famous, that by his own
      industry, without the help of Learning, he attained to an
      extraordinary height in all strains of Dramatick Poetry,
      especially in the Comick part, wherein we may say he outwent
      himself; yet was he not so much given to Festivity, but that he
      could (when so disposed) be solemn and serious; so that
      <i>Heraclitus</i> himself might afford to smile at his Comedies,
      they were so merry, and <i>Democritus</i> scarce forbear to sigh
      at his Tragedies, they were so mournful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor were his Studies altogether confined to the Stage, but had
      excursions into other kinds of Poetry, witness his Poem of the
      <i>Rape of Lucrece</i>, and that of <i>Venus and Adonis</i>;
      wherein, to give you a taste of the loftiness of his Style, we
      shall insert some few Lines of the beginning of the latter.

      He was an eminent instance of the truth of that Rule, <i>Poeta

      that as <i>Cornish Diamonds</i> are not polished by any Lapidary,
      but are pointed and smoothed even as they are taken out of the
      Earth, so Nature itself was all the Art which was used on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was so great a Benefactor to the Stage, that he wrote of
      himself eight and forty Plays; whereof 18 Comedies, <i>viz.</i>
      <i>As you like it</i>, <i>All's well that ends well</i>, <i>A
      Comedy of Errors</i>, <i>Gentleman of</i> Verona, <i>Loves Labour
      lost</i>, London <i>Prodigal</i>, <i>Merry Wives of</i> Windsor,
      <i>Measure for measure</i>, <i>Much ado about Nothing</i>,
      <i>Midsummer Nights Dream</i>, <i>Merchant of</i> Venice,
      <i>Merry Devil of</i> Edmonton, <i>Mucedorus, the Puritan
      Widow</i>, <i>the Tempest</i>, <i>Twelf-Night</i>, or <i>what you
      will</i>, <i>the taming of the Shrew</i>, and <i>a winters
      Tale</i>. Fourteen Tragedies, <i>viz.</i> <i>Anthony and
      Cleopatra</i>, <i>Coriolanus</i>, <i>Cymbeline</i>,
      <i>Hamlet</i>, <i>Julius Cæsar</i>, <i>Lorrino</i>, <i>Leir and
      his three Daughters</i>, <i>Mackbeth</i>, <i>Othello the Moor
      of</i> Venice, <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, <i>Troylus and
      Cressida</i>, <i>Tymon of</i> Athens, <i>Titus Andronicus</i>,
      and <i>the Yorkshire Tragedy</i>. Also fifteen Histories,
      <i>viz.</i> Cromwel's <i>History</i>, <i>Henry</i> 4. in two
      parts, <i>Henry</i> 5. <i>Henry</i> 6. in three parts,
      <i>Henry</i> 8. <i>John King of</i> England, in three parts,
      <i>Pericles Prince of</i> Tyre, <i>Richard</i> 2. <i>Richard</i>
      3. and <i>Oldrastes Life and Death</i>. Also <i>the Arraignment
      of Paris</i>, a Pastoral.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many were the Wit-combats betwixt him and <i>Ben Johnson</i>,
      which two we may compare to a <i>Spanish great Gallion</i>, and
      an <i>English Man of war</i>: Mr. <i>Johnson</i>, (like the
      former) was built far higher in Learning, solid, but slow in his
      performances; <i>Shakespear</i>, with the <i>English Man of
      war</i>, lesser in Bulk, but lighter in sayling, could turn with
      all Tides, tack about, and take advantage of all Winds, by the
      quickness of his Wit and Invention. His History of <i>Henry</i>
      the Fourth is very much commended by some, as being full of
      sublime Wit, and as much condemned by others, for making Sir
      <i>John Falstaffe</i> the property of Pleasure for Prince
      <i>Henry</i> to abuse, as one that was a <i>Thrasonical Puff</i>,
      and emblem of mock Valour; though indeed he was a man of Arms
      every inch of him, and as valiant as any <ins class="correction"

    <p>
      <i>Christopher Marlow</i> was (as we said) not only contemporary
      with <i>William Shakespear</i>, but also, like him, rose from an
      Actor, to be a maker of Comedies and Tragedies, yet was he much
      inferior to <i>Shakespear</i> not only in the number of his
      Plays, but also in the elegancy of his Style. His Pen was chiefly
      employ'd in Tragedies; namely, his <i>Tamberlain</i> the first
      and second Part, <i>Edward</i> the Second, <i>Lust's
      Dominion</i>, or <i>the Lascivious Queen</i>, the <i>Massacre
      of</i> Paris, his <i>Jew of</i> Malta, a Tragi-comedy, and his
      Tragedy of <i>Dido</i>, in which he was joyned with <i>Nash</i>.
      But none made such a great Noise as his Comedy of <i>Doctor
      Faustus</i> with his Devils, and such like tragical Sport, which
      pleased much the humors of the Vulgar. He also begun a Poem of
      <i>Hero</i> and <i>Leander</i>; wherein he seemed to have a
      resemblance of that clear and unsophisticated Wit which was
      natural to <i>Musæus</i> that incomparable Poet. This Poem being
      left unfinished by <i>Marlow</i> who in some riotous Fray came to
      an untimely and violent end, was thought worthy of the finishing
      hand of <i>Chapman</i>, as we intimated before; in the
      performance whereof, nevertheless he fell short of the Spirit and
      Invention with which it was begun.

    </h2>
    <p>
      This Famous Poet was born at <i>Houghton</i> in
      <i>Northampton-shire</i>, and was first bred in
      <i>Westminster-School</i>, then Fellow in <i>Trinity-Colledge</i>
      in <i>Cambridge</i>; He was one of such a pregnant Wit, that the
      Muses may seem not only to have smiled, but to have been tickled
      at his Nativity, such the festivity of his Poems of all sorts.
      Yet was he also sententiously grave, as may appear by many of his
      Writings, not only in his <i>Necessary Precepts</i>, but also in
      several other of his Poems; take one instance in the conclusion
      of his Commendatory Verses to Mr. <i>Feltham</i>, on his
      excellent Book of <i>Resolves</i>.

      His extraordinary indulgence to the too liberal converse with the
      multitude of his applauders, drew him to such an immoderate way
      of living, that he was seldom out of Gentlemens company, and as
      it often happens that in drinking high quarrels arise, so there
      chanced some words to pass betwixt Mr. <i>Randolf</i> and another
      Gentleman, which grew to be so high, that the Gentleman drawing
      his Sword, and striking at Mr. <i>Randolph</i>, cut off his
      little finger, whereupon, in an extemporary humour, he instantly
      made these Verses:

      That he was of a free generous disposition, not regarding at all

      His Poems publish'd after his death, and usher'd into the World

      Mr. <i>Randolph</i> having been at <i>London</i> so long as that

      wanting Money, which to an ingenious spirit is the most daunting

      being espied by <i>Ben. Johnson</i>, and seeing him in a Scholars

      accordingly he did, when immediately they began to rime upon the
      meanness of his Clothes, asking him, If he could not make a

    <p>
      This worthy Doctor, though we find not many Verses of his own
      Composing, yet is deservedly placed amongst the Poets; for his
      numerous Translations of so many Authors: insomuch that he might
      be called the Translator General of his Age; So that those Books
      alone of his turning into English, are sufficient to make a
      Country Gentleman a Competent Library for Historians. He is
      thought to have his Birth in <i>Warwick-shire</i>, but more
      certain to have his Breeding in <i>Trinity Colledge</i> in
      <i>Cambridge</i>; where he so Profited, that he became Doctor of
      Physick: and practised the same in <i>Coventry</i> in his (if so
      it were) native Country. Here did he begin and finish the
      Translation of so many Authors, that considering their
      Voluminousness, a Man would think he had done nothing else; which
      made one thus to descant on him.

      Now as he was a Translator of many Authors, so was he very
      Faithful in what he did; But what commended him most in the
      Praise of Posterity, was his Translating <i>Cambdens
      Britania</i>, a Translation more then a Translation: he adding to
      it many more notes then what were first in the Lattin Edition,
      but such as were done by Mr. <i>Cambden</i> in his Life time,
      discoverable in the former part with Astericks in the Margent;
      But these Additions with some Antiquaries obtain not equal
      Authenticalness with what was set forth by Mr. <i>Cambden</i>
      himself.

      lines to favour more of the Grape than the Lamp; Indeed he made
      it his Recreation, not his Study, and did not so much seek fame
      as it was put upon him: In my mind he gives the best Character of

      Besides his Poems, he wrote three Plays, the <i>Goblins</i> a

      great defection of Scotch Loyalty in 1639. freely gave the King a
      hundred Horses. And for his Poems, I shall conclude with what the
      Author of his Epistle to the Reader saies of them, <i>It had been

      wrote the History of the Reign of King <i>Edward</i> the Fourth,

      byassed to Devotion; Here at leisure times did he exercise
      himself in those ravishing delights of Poetry, but (alwaies with
      the <i>Psalmist</i>) his <i>heart was inditing a good matter</i>;
      these in time produced those excellent works of his, <i>viz.</i>
      his Histories of <i>Jonas</i>, <i>Esther</i>, <i>Job</i>, and
      <i>Sampson</i>; his <i>Sions Songs</i> and <i>Sions Elegies</i>,
      also his <i>Euchyridion</i>, all of them of such a heavenly
      strain, as if he had drank of <i>Jordan</i> instead of
      <i>Helicon</i>, and slept on Mount <i>Olivet</i> for his
      <i>Pernassus</i>. He had also other excursions into the
      delightful walks of Poetry, namely, his <i>Argulus</i> and
      <i>Parthenia</i>, a Science (as he himself saith) taken out of
      Sir <i>Philip Sidney's</i> Orchard, likewise his <i>Epigrams</i>,
      <i>Shepherds Oracles</i>, Elegies on several persons, his
      <i>Hierogliphicks</i>, but especially his <i>Emblems</i>, wherein
      he hath <i>Out-Alciated Alcialus</i> himself. There hath been
      also acted a Comedy of his called, <i>The Virgin Widdow</i>,
      which passed with no ordinary applause. But afterwards the
      Rebellion breaking forth in <i>Ireland</i> (where his losses were
      very great) he was forced to come over; and being a true Loyalist
      to his Soveraign, was again plundred of his Estate here, but what
      he took most to heart (for as for his other losses he practiced
      the patience of <i>Job</i> he had described) was his being
      plundred of his Books, and some rare Manuscripts which he
      intended for the Press, the loss of which, as it is thought,
      facilitated his death, which happned about the year of our Lord,
      1643. to whose memory one dedicated these lines by way of

      <i>Alexander Broome</i> our English <i>Anacreon</i>, was an
      Attorney in the Lord Mayors Court; who besides his practice in
      Law, addicted himself to a Jovial strain in the ravishing
      Delights of Poetry; being the ingenious Author of most of those
      Songs, which on the Royalists account came forth during the time
      of the <i>Rump</i>, and <i>Oliver's</i> Usurpation; and were sung
      so often by the Sons of Mirth and <i>Bacchus</i>, and plaid to by
      the sprightly Violin. Take for a tast a verse of one of his
      Songs.

      <a name="john_c" id="john_c"></a>Mr. <i>JOHN CLEVELAND</i>.
    </h2>
    <p>
      This eminent Poet, the Wit of our age, was born at
      <i>Hinckley</i>, a small Market Town in the County of
      <i>Leicester</i>, where his Father was the Reverend and Learned
      Minister of the place. <i>Fortes creantur e fortibus</i>, and
      bred therein under Mr. <i>Richard Vines</i> his School-master,
      where he attained to a great perfection in Learning, by choicest
      Elegancies in Greek and Latin, more elegantly English; so that he
      may be said to have lisped wit, like an English <i>Bard</i>, and
      early ripe accomplished for the University.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a loving Father and learned School-Master, he was sent to
      <i>Christ Colledge</i> in <i>Cambridge</i>, where he proved such
      an exquisite Orator, and pure Latinist, as those his Deserts
      preferred him to a Fellowship in St. <i>Johns</i>. There he lived
      about the space of nine Years, the Delight and Ornament of that
      Society; what service as well as reputation he did it, let his
      excellent Orations and Epistles speak: To which the Library oweth
      much of its Learning, the Chapel much of its pious Decency, and
      the Colledge much of its Renown.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was (saith Dr. <i>Fuller</i>) a general Artist, pure Latinist,
      exquisite Orator, and (which was his Master-Piece) eminent Poet;
      whose verses in the time of the Civil War begun to be in great
      request, both for their Wit and Zeal to the King's Cause, for
      which indeed he appeared the first, if not only Champion in verse
      against the <i>Presbyterian</i> party. His Epistles were pregnant
      with Metaphors, carrying in them a difficult plainness, difficult
      at the hearing, plain at the considering thereof. His lofty Fancy
      may seem to stride from the top of one Mountain to the top of
      another, so making to it self a constant Level and Champian of
      continued Elevations.
    </p>
    <p>
      These his eminent parts preferr'd him to be Rhetorick Reader,
      which he performed with great Applause; and indeed, what was it
      in which he did not excel? This alone may suffice for his Honour,
      that after the Oration which he addressed to that incomparable
      Prince of Blessed Memory, <i>Charles</i> the First; His Majesty
      called for him, gave him his hand to Kiss, and (with great
      expressions of kindness) commanded a Copy to be sent after him,
      whither he was hasting that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such who have <i>Clevelandiz'd</i>, that is, endeavoured to
      imitate his Masculine stile, yet could never go beyond his Poem
      of the <i>Hermaphrodite</i>; which though inserted into Mr.
      <i>Randolphs</i> Poems (one of as high a tow'ring Wit as most in
      that age;) yet is well known to be Mr. <i>Clevelands</i>; it
      being not only made after Mr. <i>Randolph's</i> death, but hath
      in it the very <i>vein</i> and strain of Mr. <i>Cleveland's</i>
      Writing, walking from one height to another, in a constant Level
      of continued Elevation. And indeed so elaborate are all his other
      pieces of Poetry, as to praise one were to detract from the rest,
      and are not to be the less valued by the Reader, because most
      studyed by the Writer: Take but a taste of the Loftiness of his
      stile, in those verses of his called <i>Smectymnuus</i>.

      Thus he shined with equal Light and Influence, until that great
      defection of Loyalty over-spread the Land, and Rebellion began to
      unvizard it self; of which no Man had more sagacious
      Prognosticks, of which take this one instance; when <i>Oliver
      Cromwell</i> was in Election to be Burgess for the Town of
      <i>Cambridge</i>, as he ingaged all his Friends and Interests to
      oppose it; so when it was passed, he said with much passionate
      zeal, <i>That single vote ruined both Church and Kingdom</i>;
      such fatal events did he presage from his bloody Beak: For no
      sooner did that <i>Harpey</i> appear in the University, but he
      made good what was predicted of him, and he amongst others, that
      were outed for their Loyalty, was turned out of his Fellowship at
      St. <i>Johns</i>; out of which Loyal Colledge was then ejected
      Dr. <i>Beal</i> the Master, thirteen Batchellors of Divinity, and
      fourteen Masters of Art, besides Mr. <i>Cleveland</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now being forced from the Colledge, he betook himself to the
      Camp, and particularly to <i>Oxford</i> the Head quarter of it,
      as the most proper and proportionate Sphere for his Wit,
      Learning, and Loyalty; and added no small Lustre to that famous
      University, with which it shined before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he managed his Pen as the highest Panegyrist (witness his
      <i>Rupertismus</i>, his Elegy on the Bishop of <i>Canterbury</i>,
      &amp;c.) on the one side to draw out all good inclinations to
      vertue: and the smartist Satyrist, exemplifi'd in the <i>Rebel
      Scot</i>, the <i>Scots Apostacy</i>, which he presented with such
      a Satyrical Fury, that the whole Nation fares the worse for it,
      lying under a most grievous Poetical Censure. Such also were his
      Poem of <i>The mixt Assembly</i>, his Character of a
      <i>London</i> Diurnal, and a <i>Committee-Man</i>; Blows that
      shakes triumphing Rebellion, reaching the Souls of those not to
      be reached by Law or Power, striking each Traytor to a Paleness,
      beyond that of any Loyal Corps, that bled by them; such
      Characters being as indelible as Guilt stabs beyond Death.
    </p>
    <p>
      From <i>Oxford</i>, his next stage was the Garrison of
      <i>Newark</i>, where he was Judge Advocate until the Surrender
      thereof; and by an excellent temperature of both, was a just and
      prudent Judge for the King, and a faithful Advocate for the
      Country. Here he drew up that excellent Answer and Rejoynder to a
      Parliament Officer, who had sent him a Letter by occasion of one
      <i>Hill</i>, that had deserted their side, and brought with him
      to <i>Newark</i> the sum of 133 <i>l.</i> and 8<i>d.</i> I shall
      only give you part of Mr. <i>Clevelands</i> Answer to his first
      Letter, by which you may give an Estimate of the rest.

    <p>
      Sixthly, <i>Beloved it is so, that our Brother and
      fellow-Labourer in the Gospel is Start aside; then this may serve
      for an use of instruction, not to trust in Man, or in the Son of
      Man. Did not</i> Demas <i>leave</i> Paul, <i>did not</i> Onesimus
      <i>run from his Master</i> Philemon? <i>Also this should teach us
      to employ our Talents, and not to lay them up in a Napkin</i>;
      <i>had it been done among the Cavaliers, it had been just, then
      the</i> Israelite <i>had spoiled the</i> Ægyptian: <i>but for</i>
      Simeon <i>to plunder</i> Levi,
      <i>that</i>&mdash;that&mdash;<i>&amp;c.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      This famous Garrison was maintained with much courage and
      resolution against the Besiegers, and not surrendred but by the
      King's special Command, when first he had surrendred himself into
      the hands of the <i>Scots</i>; in which action of that Royal
      Martyr, we may conclude our <i>Cleveland Vates,</i> both Poet and
      Prophet: For besides his passionate resentment of it in that
      excellent Poem, <i>The Kings disguise</i>; upon some private
      intelligence, three days before the King reached them, he foresaw
      the pieces of Silver paying upon the banks of <i>Tweed</i>, and
      that they were the price of his Sovereigns Blood, and predicted
      the Tragical events.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thenceforth he followed the fate of distressed Loyalty, subject
      to the Malice and Vengeance of every Fanatick Spirit, which
      seldom terminates but in a Goal, which befel this learned Person,
      being long imprisoned at <i>Yarmouth</i>: where living in a
      lingering Condition, and having small hopes of coming out, he
      composed an Address to that Idol at <i>White-Hall, Oliver
      Cromwell</i>, written with such Tow'ring Language, and so much
      gallant Reason, as looked bigger than his Highness, shrinking
      before the Majesty of his Pen, as <i>Felix</i> trembled before
      <i>Paul</i>. So obtaining his Liberty, not by a servile
      Submission, but rather a constrained Violence, neither injuring
      his Conscience, nor betraying his Cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so now with <i>Daniel</i> being delivered out of the Lyons
      Den, he was courted to several places, (which contended as
      emulously for his abode, as the seven <i>Grecian</i> Cities for
      <i>Homers</i> Birth;) at last he setled in <i>Grays-Inn</i>,
      which when he had enobled with some short time of his residence,
      an intermitting Fever seized him, whereof he dyed, on
      <i>Thursday</i> Morning, <i>April</i> the 29. 1658. from whence
      his Body was brought to <i>Hunsden-House</i>, and on
      <i>Saturday</i> being <i>May-day</i>, was buried at
      <i>Colledgehill-Church</i>; His dear Friend Dr. <i>John
      Pearson</i> (afterwards Lord Bishop of <i>Chester</i>) preached
      his Funeral Sermon, who rendred this Reason; why he cautiously
      declined all commending of the Party deceased, Because such
      praising of him would not be adequate to any expectation in that
      Auditory; seeing some, who knew him not, would think it far above
      him, while those, who knew him must needs know it far below him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many there were who sought to eternize their own Names by
      honouring his; some by Elegies, and other Devices, amongst the
      rest one made this Anagram upon his name.

      The difficult Trifle (saith one) is rather well endeavoured, than
      exactly performed. More happy were those Wits, who descanted on
      him and his works in Verse, although so eminent a Poet was never
      interred with fewer Elegies than he; for which we may assign two
      Reasons, One that at that time the best Fancies of the <i>Royal
      Party</i> were in restraint, so that we may in part think their
      Muses confin'd, as well as their Bodies. Secondly, not to do it
      to the heighth, were in a manner to dispraise him. However I

    <p>
      Sir <i>John Berkenhead</i> was a Gentleman, whose Worth and
      deserts were too high for me to delineate. He was a constant
      Assertor of his Majesties Cause in its lowest Condition, painting
      the Rebels forth to the life in his <i>Mercurius Aulicus</i> and
      other Writings; his <i>Zany Brittanicus</i> who wrote against
      him, being no more his Equal, than a Dwarf to a Gyant, or the
      goodness of his cause to that of the Kings; for this his Loyalty
      he suffered several Imprisonments, yet always constant to his
      first Principles. His skill in Poetry was such, that one thus
      writes of him.

      He was one, and not of the meanest of the Poetical Cassock, being

      high, and standing up as stifly for the <i>Presbyterians</i>, as
      ever <i>Cleaveland</i> did against them: But that which most
      recommended him to publick fame, was his <i>Iter Roreale</i>, the
      same in Title though not in Argument, with that little, but much
      commended Poem of Dr. <i>Corbets</i> mentioned before. This being
      upon General <i>Monk's</i> Journey out of <i>Scotland</i>, in
      order to his Majesties Restoration, and is indeed the Cream and
      flower of all his Works, and look't upon for a lofty and
      conceited Stile. His other things are for the most part of a
      tepid and facetious nature, reflecting on others, who as sharply
      retorted upon him, for he that throwes stones at other, 'tis ten
      to one but is hit with a stone himself; one of them playing upon
      his red face thus. I <i>like the Man that carries in his

      to dawn at the Thirteenth year of his age, being then a Scholar
      at <i>Westminster</i>-School which produc'd two little Poems, the
      one called <i>Antonius</i> and <i>Melida</i>, the other
      <i>Pyramus</i> and <i>Thisbe</i>; discovering in them a maturity
      of Sence far above the years that writ them; shewing by these his
      early Fruits, what in time his stock of worth would come to. And
      indeed Fame was not deceived in him of its Expectation, he having
      built a lasting Monument of his worth to posterity, in that
      compleat Volume of his Works, divided into four parts: His
      Mistress, being the amorous Prolusions of his youthful Muse; his
      Miscelanies, or Poems of various arguments; his most admired
      Heroick Poem <i>Davideis</i>, the first Books whereof he compos'd
      while but a young Student at <i>Trinity</i>-Colledge in
      <i>Cambridge</i>; and lastly, that is, in order of time though
      not of place, his <i>Pindaric Odes</i>, so call'd from the
      Measure, in which he translated the first <i>Ithmian</i> and
      <i>Nemean Odes</i>, where as the form of those <i>Odes</i> in the
      <i>Original</i> is very different, yet so well were they approved
      by succeeding Authors, that our primest Wits have hitherto driven
      a notable Trade in <i>Pindaric Odes</i>. But besides these his
      <i>English</i> Poems, there is extant of his writing a Latine
      Volume by it self, containing a Poem of Herbs and Plants: Also he
      Translated two Books of his <i>Davideis</i> into Latine Verse,

      This Reverend Prelate, a great lover of Musick, Poetry, and other
      ingenious Arts; amongst his other graver Studies, had some
      Excursions into those pleasing Delights of Poetry; and as he was
      of an Obliging Conversation for his Wit and Fancy; so was he also
      very Grave and Pious in his Writings; Witness his Printed Sermons
      on the Lords Prayer, and others which he Preached on several
      Occasions. His Father was <i>John King</i>, Bishop of
      <i>London</i>; one full fraught with all Episcopal Qualities; who
      died <i>Anno</i> 1618. and was Buried in the Quire of St.
      <i>Paul's</i>, with the plain Epitaph of <i>Resurgam</i>: But
      since a prime Wit did enlarge thereon, which for the Elegancy of
      it, I cannot but commit it to Posterity.

      <i>Tame</i> in <i>Buckingham-shire</i>, and was Bred up at
      <i>Christ-Church</i> in <i>Oxford</i>. in <i>Anno</i> 1641. when
      Episcopacy was beheld by many in a deep <i>Consumption</i>, and
      hoped by others that it would prove Mortal. To cure this, it was
      conceived the most probable Cordial to prefer Persons into that
      Order, not only unblameable for their Life, and eminent for their
      Learning; but also generally, beloved, by all <ins class=

      But all would not do, their Innocency was so far from stopping
      the Mouth of Malice; that Malice had almost swallowed them down

      live a most religious Life, and at leisure times Composed his
      generally admired and approved Version of <i>Davids</i> Psalms
      into <i>English</i> Meetre.

    <p>
      <i>Richard Head</i>, the Noted Author of the <i>English
      Rogue</i>, was a Ministers Son, born in <i>Ireland</i>, whose
      Father was killed in that horrid Rebellion in 1641. Whereupon his
      Mother with this her Son came into <i>England</i>; and he having
      been trained up in Learning, was by the help of some Friends, for
      some little time brought up in the University of <i>Oxford</i>,
      in the same Colledge wherein his Father had formerly been a
      Student. But means falling short, he was taken away from thence,
      and bound Apprentice to a Latin Bookseller in <i>London</i>;
      attaining to a good Proficiency in that Trade. But his Genius
      being addicted to Poetry, and having <i>Venus</i> for his
      Horoscope, e're his time were fully out, he wrote a Piece called
      <i>Venus Cabinet Unlock'd</i>: Afterwards he married, and set up
      for himself: But being addicted to play, a Mans Estate then runs
      in <i>Hazard</i>, (for indeed that was his Game) until he had
      almost thrown his Shop away. Then he betook himself to
      <i>Ireland</i>, his Native Country; where he composed his <i>Hic
      &amp; Ubique</i>, a noted Comedy; and which gained him a general
      Esteem for the worth thereof. And coming over into
      <i>England</i>, had it Printed, dedicating it to the then Duke of
      <i>Monmouth</i>; But receiving no great Incouragement from his
      Patron, he resolved to settle himself in the World, and to that
      purpose, with his Wife took a House in <i>Queens-Head Alley</i>,
      near <i>Pater-Noster-Row</i>; and for a while followed his
      Business, so that contrary to the Nature of a Poet, his Pockets
      began to be well lined with Money: But being bewitched to that
      accursed vice of Play, it went out by handfuls, as it came in
      piece by piece. And now he is to seek again in the World,
      whereupon he betook him to his Pen; and wrote the first part of
      the <i>English Rogue</i>: which being too much smutty, would not
      be Licensed, so that he was fain to refine it, and then it passed
      stamp. At the coming forth of this first part, I being with him
      at three Cup Tavern in <i>Holborn</i>, drinking over a glass of
      <i>Rhenish</i>, made these verses upon it.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
